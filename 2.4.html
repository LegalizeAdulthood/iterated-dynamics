 2.4 Inverse Julias

  (type=julia_inverse)

  Pick a function, such as the familiar Z(n) = Z(n-1) squared plus C (the
  defining function of the Mandelbrot Set).  If you pick a point Z(0) at
  random from the complex plane, and repeatedly apply the function to it,
  you get a sequence of new points called an orbit, which usually either
  zips out toward infinity or zooms in toward one or more "attractor"
  points near the middle of the plane.  The set of all points that are
  "attracted" to infinity is called the "Basin of Attraction" of infinity.
  Each of the other attractors also has its own Basin of Attraction.  Why
  is it called a Basin?  Imagine a lake, and all the water in it
  "draining" into the attractor.  The boundary between these basins is
  called the Julia Set of the function.

  The boundary between the basins of attraction is sort of like a
  repeller; all orbits move away from it, toward one of the attractors.
  But if we define a new function as the inverse of the old one, as for
  instance Z(n) = sqrt(Z(n-1) minus C), then the old attractors become
  repellers, and the former boundary itself becomes the attractor!  Now,
  starting from any point, all orbits are drawn irresistibly to the Julia
  Set!  In fact, once an orbit reaches the boundary, it will continue to
  hop about until it traces the entire Julia Set!  This method for drawing
  Julia Sets is called the Inverse Iteration Method, or IIM for short.

  Unfortunately, some parts of each Julia Set boundary are far more
  attractive to inverse orbits than others are, so that as an orbit traces
  out the set, it keeps coming back to these attractive parts again and
  again, only occasionally visiting the less attractive parts.  Thus it
  may take an infinite length of time to draw the entire set.  To hasten
  the process, we can keep track of how many times each pixel on our
  computer screen is visited by an orbit, and whenever an orbit reaches a
  pixel that has already been visited more than a certain number of times,
  we can consider that orbit finished and move on to another one.  This
  "hit limit" thus becomes similar to the iteration limit used in the
  traditional escape-time fractal algorithm.  This is called the Modified
  Inverse Iteration Method, or MIIM, and is much faster than the IIM.

  Now, the inverse of Mandelbrot's classic function is a square root, and
  the square root actually has two solutions; one positive, one negative.
  Therefore at each step of each orbit of the inverse function there is a
  decision; whether to use the positive or the negative square root.  Each
  one gives rise to a new point on the Julia Set, so each is a good
  choice.  This series of choices defines a binary decision tree, each
  point on the Julia Set giving rise to two potential child points.  There
  are many interesting ways to traverse a binary tree, among them Breadth
  first, Depth first (left or negative first), Depth first (right or
  positive first), and completely at random.  It turns out that most
  traversal methods lead to the same or similar pictures, but that how the
  image evolves as the orbits trace it out differs wildly depending on the
  traversal method chosen.  As far as we know, this fact is an original
  discovery by Michael Snyder, and version 18.2 of FRACTINT was its first
  publication.

  Pick a Julia constant such as Z(0) = (-.74543, .11301), the popular
  Seahorse Julia, and try drawing it first Breadth first, then Depth first
  (right first), Depth first (left first), and finally with Random Walk.

  Caveats: the video memory is used in the algorithm, to keep track of how
  many times each pixel has been visited (by changing it's color).
  Therefore the algorithm will not work well if you zoom in far enough
  that part of the Julia Set is off the screen.

  Bugs:   Not working with Disk Video.
          Not resumeable.
