<p>Iterated Dynamics is a fork of the DOS program Fractint.  Fractint has
its own history spanning many years.  Please consult the Fractint help
for its history.  To avoid being confused with a new release of
Fractint, the code has been rebranded Iterated Dynamics, or Id for
short, throughout.</p>

<p>New Features in Version 1.3.1</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Colormap channels are no longer restricted to 6 bits.  Encoded colors
when generating parameter sets are now extended to encode 8-bit color
channels values without loss of precision.  When reading previous
parameter sets that encoded 6-bit values the value is loaded into the
6 most significant bits of the 8-bit color channel value.  Colors
written to image files use the full 8-bit colors.  (Fixes #47, #61)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The palette editor was updated to work with 8-bit colors.  (Fixes
#306)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bugs Fixed in Version 1.3.1</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Periodic automatic image save, activated by the savetime parameter,
has been restored.  (Fixes #43)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some Fractal of the Day image regressions have been fixed.  (Fixes
#99, #103)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests have been added
to the github repository.  (Fixes #265)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The help compiler documentation has been overhauled and updated for
the AsciiDoc output features.  (Fixes #276)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset and <kbd>Insert</kbd> now reset "inside" color consistently to zero.
(Fixes #279)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements were made to the continuous integration build and test
mechanisms on github.  (Fixes #280, #293)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code configuration was generalized to test for features and not be
based on the platform name to enable building on FreeBSD.  (Fixes
#292)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When log(z) stores the output in the same variable as the input, it no
longer corrupts the output variable.  (Fixes #295)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The float parameter has been deprecated and is ignored.  Discussion of
integer math removed from the documentation.  (Fixes #303)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarify operator precedence and line continuation in the documentation
for type=formula.  (Fixes #304)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions of the fractal types are now arranged alphabetically in
the plain text and HTML documentation files, making it easier to find
information on a specific fractal type.  (Fixes #305)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first value to the mathtolerance parameter is ignored; it
previously was used to control the transition from integer to
floating-point math.  When writing parameter sets, the first value is
now omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The delay value is now properly displayed for type=ant.  (Fixes #387)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code Cleanup in Version 1.3.1</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>More unused integer math routines were removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions used to initialize the FractalSpecific array were renamed to
remove floating-point annotations and match the FractalSpecific member
name (e.g. orbit, per_pixel, per_image, calc_type).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Known limitations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This initial implementation of perturbation does not support
periodicity checking and only supports a limited number of inside and
outside coloring algorithms.  Suspend and resume is not supported with
perturbation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sound output does nothing, although all controls can be set through
parameters or interactive screens.  Sound output will be restored once
a suitable audio library has been identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some formulas don&#8217;t render correctly.  These problems have been around
forever as xfractint also renders them incorrectly.  This will be
fixed in a subsequent release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code compiles on Linux, but the Linux port is incomplete and is
planned on being completed with the switch to wxWidgets in version
2.0.  It may be feasible to run the Windows version of Id, via the ZIP
package, under Wine (Windows Emulation), but this has not been
verified.  Give it a try and let us know if it works!</p>

<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Iterated Dynamics, or Id for short, plots and manipulates images of
"objects"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;actually, sets of mathematical points&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that have fractal
dimension.  See <a href="#_fractals_and_the_pc">Fractals and the PC</a> for some historical and mathematical
background on fractal geometry, a discipline named and popularized by
mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.  For now, these sets of points have
three important properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1) They are generated by relatively simple calculations repeated over
and over, feeding the results of each step back into the next&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;something computers can do very rapidly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2) They are, quite literally, infinitely complex: they reveal more and
more detail without limit as you plot smaller and smaller areas.  Id
lets you "zoom in" by positioning a small box and hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> to
redraw the boxed area at full-screen size; its maximum linear
"magnification" is over a trillionfold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3) They can be astonishingly beautiful, especially when assigning colors
to selected points, and to "animate" the images by quickly shifting
those color assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a demonstration of some of Id&#8217;s features, run the demonstration file
included with this release (demo.bat) by typing "demo" at the command
prompt.  You can stop the demonstration at any time by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name Iterated Dynamics was chosen because the program generates its
images by iterating some kind of dynamical system exhibiting non-linear
or chaotic behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many open source projects, Iterated Dynamics is an experiment in
collaboration.  While being an offshoot of its ancestor, Fractint,
Iterated Dynamics in no way changes the spirit of collaboration started
with that program by its original author Bert Tyler.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_getting_started">Getting Started</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start the program, locate the Id executable in the installation
directory.  The program displays an initial "credits" screen.  If Id
doesn&#8217;t start properly, please see <a href="#_common_problems">Common Problems</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> gets you from the initial screen to the main menu.  You
can select options from the menu by moving the highlight with the arrow
keys (<kbd>Left</kbd>, <kbd>Right</kbd>, <kbd>Up</kbd>, <kbd>Down</kbd>) and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, or you can
enter commands directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As soon as you select a video mode, Id begins drawing an image - the
"full" Mandelbrot set if you haven&#8217;t selected another fractal type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a quick start, after starting Id try one of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Win32 GDI 800x600 small size image:       <kbd>F6</kbd></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win32 GDI 1024x768 medium size image:     <kbd>F7</kbd></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win32 GDI 1200x900 large size image:      <kbd>F8</kbd></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the initial Mandelbrot image has been displayed, try zooming into
it (see <a href="#_zoom_box_commands">Zoom Box Commands</a>) and color cycling (see <a href="#_color_cycling_commands">Color Cycling Commands</a>
).  Once you&#8217;re comfortable with these basics, start exploring other
functions from the main menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Help is available from the menu and at most other points in Id by
pressing the <kbd>F1</kbd> key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any time, you can hit a command key to select a function.  You do not
need to wait for a calculation to finish, nor do you have to return to
the main menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When entering commands, note that for the "typewriter" keys, upper and
lower case are equivalent in most situations, e.g. <kbd>B</kbd> and <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd></span>
have the same result.  When an upper case letter is required, such as
telling Id to delete the current file in browse mode, it will be
described as <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many commands and parameters can be passed to Id as command-line
arguments or read from a configuration file; see
<a href="#_introduction_to_parameters">Introduction to Parameters</a> for details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_plotting_commands">Plotting Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Function keys &amp; various combinations are used to select a video mode and
redraw the screen.  For a quick start try one of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Win32 GDI 800x600 small size image:       <kbd>F6</kbd></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win32 GDI 1024x768 medium size image:     <kbd>F7</kbd></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win32 GDI 1200x900 large size image:      <kbd>F8</kbd></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>F1</kbd>
Display a help screen.  The function keys available in help mode are
displayed at the bottom of the help screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>M</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd>
Return from a displayed image to the main menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Esc</kbd>
From the main menu, <kbd>Esc</kbd> is used to exit from Id.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Delete</kbd>
Same as choosing "select video mode" from the main menu.  Goes to the
"select video mode" screen.  See <a href="#_video_mode_function_keys">Video Mode Function Keys</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>H</kbd>
Redraw the previous image in the circular history buffer, revisiting
fractals you previously generated this session in reverse order.  Id
saves the last ten images worth of information including fractal type,
coordinates, colors, and all options.  Image information is saved only
when some item changes.  After ten images the circular buffer wraps
around and earlier information is overwritten.  You can set image
capacity of the history feature using the maxhistory=&lt;nnn&gt; command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd></span>
Redraw the next image in the circular history buffer.  Use this to
return to images you passed by when using <kbd>H</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Tab</kbd>
Display the current fractal type, parameters, video mode, screen or (if
displayed) zoom-box coordinates, maximum iteration count, and other
information useful in keeping track of where you are.  The Tab function
is non-destructive - if you press it while in the midst of generating an
image, you will continue generating it when you return.  The Tab
function tells you if your image is still being generated or has
finished - a handy feature for those overnight, 1024x768 resolution
fractal images.  If the image is incomplete, it also tells you whether
it can be interrupted and resumed.  (Any function other than <kbd>Tab</kbd> and
<kbd>F1</kbd> counts as an "interrupt".)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tab screen also includes a pixel-counting function, which will count
the number of pixels colored in the inside color.  This gives an
estimate of the area of the fractal.  Note that the inside color must be
different from the outside color(s) for this to work; inside=0 is a good
choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>T</kbd>
Select a fractal type.  Move the cursor to your choice (or type the
first few letters of its name) and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  Next you will be
prompted for any parameters used by the selected type - hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> for
the defaults.  See <a href="#_fractal_types">Fractal Types</a> for a list of supported types.
<kbd>X</kbd>
Select a number of eXtended options.  Brings up a full-screen menu of
options, any of which you can change at will.  These options are:
  "passes=" - see <a href="#_drawing_method">Drawing Method</a>

  "orbitdrawmode=" - see <a href="#_passes_parameters">Passes Parameters</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Z</kbd>
Modify the parameters specific to the currently selected fractal type.
This command lets you modify the parameters which are requested when you
select a new fractal type with the <kbd>T</kbd> command, without having to repeat
that selection.  You can enter "e" or "p" in column one of the input
fields to get the numbers e and pi (2.71828&#8230;&#8203; and 3.14159&#8230;&#8203;).
From the fractal parameters screen, you can press <kbd>F6</kbd> to bring up a sub
parameter screen for the coordinates of the image&#8217;s corners.  With
selected fractal types, <kbd>Z</kbd> allows you to change the <a href="#_bailout_test">Bailout Test</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd>
Switch to color-cycling mode and begin cycling the palette by shifting
each color to the next "contour."  See <a href="#_color_cycling_commands">Color Cycling Commands</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>C</kbd>
Switch to color-cycling mode but do not start cycling.  The normally
black "overscan" border of the screen changes to white.  See
<a href="#_color_cycling_commands">Color Cycling Commands</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>E</kbd>
Enter Palette-Editing Mode.  See <a href="#_palette_editing_commands">Palette Editing Commands</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Space</kbd>
Toggle between Mandelbrot set images and their corresponding Julia-set
images.  Read the notes in <a href="#_julia_sets">Fractal Types, Julia Sets</a> before trying this
option if you want to see anything interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>J</kbd>
Toggle between Julia escape time fractal and the Inverse Julia orbit
fractal.  See <a href="#_inverse_julias">Inverse Julias</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Enter</kbd>
Enter is used to resume calculation after a pause.  It is only necessary
to do this when there is a message on the screen waiting to be
acknowledged, such as the message shown after you save an image to disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>I</kbd>
Modify 3D transformation parameters used with 3D fractal types such as
"Lorenz3D" and 3D "IFS" definitions, including the selection of
<a href="#_stereo_3d_viewing">"funny glasses"</a> red/blue 3D.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>A</kbd>
Convert the current image into a fractal 'starfield'.  See <a href="#_starfields">Starfields</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></span>
Unleash an image-eating ant automaton on current image.  See
<a href="#_ant_automaton">Ant Automaton</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span> (or <kbd>K</kbd>)
Convert the current image into a Random Dot Stereogram (RDS).  See
<a href="#_random_dot_stereograms_rds">Random Dot Stereograms (RDS)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>O</kbd> (the letter, not the number)
If pressed while an image is being generated, toggles the display of
intermediate results&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the "orbits" Id uses as it calculates values for
each point.  Slows the display a bit, but shows you how clever the
program is behind the scenes. (See "A Little Code" in
<a href="#_fractals_and_the_pc">Fractals and the PC</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>D</kbd>
Shell to a command prompt.  Return to Id by exiting your command shell,
usually by entering the command "exit".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Insert</kbd>
Restart at the "credits" screen and reset most variables to their
initial state.  Variables which are not reset are: savename, lightname,
video, startup filename.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>L</kbd>
Enter Browsing Mode.  See <a href="#_browse_commands">Browse Commands</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span>
Enter Explorer/Evolver Mode.  See <a href="#_evolver_commands">Evolver Commands</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_zoom_box_commands">Zoom Box Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Zoom Box functions can be invoked while an image is being generated or
when it has been completely drawn.  Zooming is supported for most
fractal types, but not all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general approach to using the zoom box is:  Frame an area using the
keys described below, then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to expand what&#8217;s in the frame to fill
the whole screen (zoom in); or <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd></span> to shrink the current image
into the framed area (zoom out).  With a mouse, double-click the primary
button to zoom in, double click the secondary button to zoom out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>PageUp</kbd>, <kbd>PageDown</kbd>
Use <kbd>PageUp</kbd> to initially bring up the zoom box.  It starts at full
screen size.  Subsequent use of these keys makes the zoom box smaller or
larger.  Using <kbd>PageDown</kbd> to enlarge the zoom box when it is already at
maximum size removes the zoom box from the display.  Moving the mouse
away from you or toward you while holding the primary button down
performs the same functions as these keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the "arrow" keys (<kbd>Left</kbd>, <kbd>Right</kbd>, <kbd>Up</kbd>, <kbd>Down</kbd>) or moving the
mouse without holding any buttons down, moves the zoom box.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while pressing arrow keys moves the box 5 times faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Panning: If you move a fullsize zoombox and don&#8217;t change anything else
before performing the zoom, Id just moves what&#8217;s already on the screen
and then fills in the new edges, to reduce drawing time.  This feature
applies to most fractal types but not all.  A side effect is that while
an image is incomplete, a full size zoom box moves in steps larger than
one pixel.  Id keeps the box on multiple pixel boundaries, to make
panning possible.  As a multi-pass (e.g. solid guessing) image
approaches completion, the zoom box can move in smaller increments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to resizing the zoom box and moving it around, you can do
some rather warped things with it.  If you&#8217;re a new Id user, we
recommend skipping the rest of the zoom box functions for now and coming
back to them when you&#8217;re comfortable with the basic zoom box functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd></span>, <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd></span>, <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Keypad-</kbd></span>, <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Keypad+</kbd></span>
Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and pressing the <kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd> keys, or the numeric keypad&#8217;s
<kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd> keys rotates the zoom box.  Moving the mouse left or right
while holding the secondary button down performs the same function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PageUp</kbd></span>, <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PageDown</kbd></span>
These commands change the zoom box&#8217;s "aspect ratio", stretching or
shrinking it vertically.  Moving the mouse away from you or toward you
while holding both buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse)
down performs the same function.  There are no commands to directly
stretch or shrink the zoom box horizontally - the same effect can be
achieved by combining vertical stretching and resizing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd></span>, <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>End</kbd></span>
These commands "skew" the zoom box, moving the top and bottom edges in
opposite directions.  Moving the mouse left or right while holding both
buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse) down performs the
same function.  There are no commands to directly skew the left and
right edges - the same effect can be achieved by using these functions
combined with rotation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

These commands change the zoom box color.  This is useful when you&#8217;re
having trouble seeing the zoom box against the colors around it.  Moving
the mouse away from you or toward you while holding the secondary button
down performs the same function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may find it difficult to figure out what combination of size,
position rotation, stretch, and skew to use to get a particular result.
(We do.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good way to get a feel for all these functions is to play with the
Gingerbreadman fractal type.  Gingerbreadman&#8217;s shape makes it easy to
see what you&#8217;re doing to him.  A warning though: Gingerbreadman will run
forever, he&#8217;s never quite done!  So, pre-empt with your next zoom when
he&#8217;s baked enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you accidentally change your zoom box shape or rotate and forget
which way is up, just use <kbd>PageDown</kbd> to make it bigger until it
disappears, then <kbd>PageUp</kbd> to get a fresh one.  With a mouse, after
removing the old zoom box from the display release and re-press the
primary button for a fresh one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your video mode does not have a 4:3 "aspect ratio" (i.e. if the
visible display area on it is not 1.333 times as wide as it is high),
rotating and zooming will have some odd effects - angles will change,
including the zoom box&#8217;s shape itself, circles (if you are so lucky as
to see any with a non-standard aspect ratio) become non-circular, and so
on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Zooming is not implemented for the plasma and diffusion fractal types,
nor for overlayed and 3D images.  A few fractal types support zooming
but do not support rotation and skewing - nothing happens when you try
it.</p>

<h3 id="_color_cycling_commands">Color Cycling Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Color-cycling mode is entered with the <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>+</kbd>, or <kbd>-</kbd> keys from an
image, or with the <kbd>C</kbd> key from Palette-Editing mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also enter color-cycling while using a disk-video mode, to load
or save a palette - other functions are not supported in disk-video.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Color cycling applies to the color numbers selected by the "cyclerange="
command line parameter (also changeable via the <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen and
via the palette editor).  By default, color numbers 1 to 255 inclusive
are cycled.  On some images you might want to set "inside=0" (<kbd>X</kbd>
options or command line parameter) to exclude the "lake" from color
cycling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are in color-cycling mode, you will either see the screen
colors cycling, or will see a white "overscan" border when paused, as a

<h3 id="_palette_editing_commands">Palette Editing Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Palette-editing mode provides a number of tools for modifying the colors
in an image.  Many thanks to Ethan Nagel for creating the palette
editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the <kbd>E</kbd> key to enter palette-editing mode from a displayed image or
from the main menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When this mode is entered, an empty palette frame is displayed.  You can
use the arrow keys to position the frame outline, and <kbd>PageUp</kbd> and
<kbd>PageDown</kbd> to change its size.  (The upper and lower limits on the size
depend on the current video mode.)  When the frame is positioned where
you want it, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to display the current palette in the frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the palette frame shows R(ed) G(reen) and B(lue) values for
two color registers at the top.  The active color register has a solid
frame, the inactive register&#8217;s frame is dotted.  Within the active
register, the active color component is framed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a video mode of 640x400 or higher, a status area appears between
the two color registers.  This status area shows:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>nnn  = color number at the cursor location
A    = Auto mode
X, Y = exclusion modes
F    = freesyle mode
T    = stripe mode is waiting for #</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the commands described below, you can assign particular colors to
the registers and manipulate them.  Note that at any given time there
are two colors "X"d - these are pre-empted by the editor to display the
palette frame.  They can be edited but the results won&#8217;t be visible.
You can change which two colors are borrowed ("X"d out) by using the <kbd>V</kbd>
command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the palette frame is displayed and filled in, the following
commands are available:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>F1</kbd>
Bring up a help screen with commands specific to palette-editing mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Esc</kbd>
Leave palette-editing mode</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>H</kbd>
Hide the palette frame to see full image; the cross-hair remains visible
and all functions remain enabled; hit <kbd>H</kbd> again to restore the palette
display.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Left</kbd>, <kbd>Right</kbd>, <kbd>Up</kbd>, <kbd>Down</kbd>
Move the cross-hair cursor around.  In 'auto' mode (the default) the
color under the center of the cross-hair is automatically assigned to
the active color register.  Control-arrow keys move the cross-hair
faster.  A mouse can also be used to move around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>G</kbd>, <kbd>B</kbd>
Select the Red, Green, or Blue component of the active color register
for subsequent commands</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Insert</kbd>, <kbd>Delete</kbd>
Select previous or next color component in active register</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>
Increase or decrease the active color component value by 1.  Numeric
keypad <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> keys do the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>PageUp</kbd>, <kbd>PageDown</kbd>
Increase or decrease the active color component value by 5; Moving the
mouse up/down with primary button held is the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>0</kbd>, <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd>, <kbd>5</kbd>, <kbd>6</kbd>
Set the active color component&#8217;s value to 0 10 20 &#8230;&#8203; 60</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Space</kbd>
Select the other color register as the active one.  In the default
'auto' mode this results in the now-inactive register being set to
remember the color under the cursor, and the now-active register
changing from whatever it had previously remembered to now follow the
color.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>,</kbd> (comma), <kbd>.</kbd> (period)
Rotate the palette one step.  By default colors 1 through 255 inclusive
are rotated.  This range can be over-ridden with the "cyclerange"
parameter, the <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen, or the <kbd>O</kbd> command described below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>&lt;</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;</kbd>
Rotate the palette continuously (until next keystroke)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>O</kbd> (oh, not zero)
Set the color cycling range to the range of colors currently defined by
the color registers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>C</kbd>
Enter Color-Cycling Mode.  When you invoke color-cycling from here, it
will subsequently return to palette-editing when you <kbd>Esc</kbd> from it.  See
<a href="#_color_cycling_commands">Color Cycling Commands</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>=</kbd>
Create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the colors selected by
the two color registers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>M</kbd>
Specify a gamma value for the shading created by <kbd>=</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>D</kbd>
Duplicate the inactive color register&#8217;s values to the active color
register.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>T</kbd>
Stripe-shade - create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the two
color registers, setting only every Nth register.  After hitting <kbd>T</kbd>,
hit a numeric key from 2 to 9 to specify N.  For example, if you press
<kbd>T</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd>, smooth shading is done between the two color registers,
affecting only every 3rd color between them.  The other colors between
them remain unchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>W</kbd>
Convert current palette to gray-scale.  (If the <kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>Y</kbd> exclude
ranges described later are in force, only the active range of colors is
converted to gray-scale.)</p>

<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd></span> &#8230;&#8203; <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd></span>
Store the current palette in a temporary save area associated with the
function key.  The temporary save palettes are useful for quickly
comparing different palettes or the effect of some changes - see next
command.  The temporary palettes are only remembered until you exit from
palette-editing mode.  When palette editing mode is entered, the
original palette is stored in the area associated with <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>F2</kbd> &#8230;&#8203; <kbd>F9</kbd>
Restore the palette from a temporary save area.  If you haven&#8217;t
previously saved a palette for the function key, you&#8217;ll get a simple
grey scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>L</kbd>
Pause and load an external color map (.map file).  See <a href="#_color_maps">Color Maps</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><kbd>S</kbd>
Pause, prompt for a filename, and save the current color palette to the
named file (.map assumed).  See <a href="#_color_maps">Color Maps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>I</kbd>
Invert frame colors.  With some colors the palette is easier to see when
the frame colors are interchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>\</kbd>
Move or resize the palette frame.  The frame outline is drawn - it can
then be repositioned and sized with the arrow keys, <kbd>PageUp</kbd> and
<kbd>PageDown</kbd>, just as was done when first entering palette-editing mode.
Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> when done moving/sizing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>V</kbd>
Use the colors currently selected by the two color registers for the
palette editor&#8217;s frame.  When palette editing mode is entered, the last
two colors are "X"d out for use by the palette editor; this command can
be used to replace the default with two other color numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>A</kbd>
Toggle 'auto' mode on or off.  When on (the default), the active color
register follows the cursor; when off, <kbd>Enter</kbd> must be pressed to set
the active register to the color under the cursor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Enter</kbd>
Only useful when 'auto' is off, as described above; double clicking the
primary mouse button is the same as <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>X</kbd>
Toggle 'exclude' mode on or off - when toggled on, only those image
pixels which match the active color are displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>Y</kbd>
Toggle 'exclude' range on or off - similar to <kbd>X</kbd>, but all pixels
matching colors in the range of the two color registers are displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>N</kbd>
Make a negative color palette - will convert only current color if in
'x' mode or range between editors in 'y' mode or entire palette if in
"normal" mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>!</kbd>, <kbd>@</kbd>, <kbd>#</kbd>
Swap R/G, G/B, and R/B columns. <kbd>!</kbd>, <kbd>@</kbd>, and <kbd>#</kbd> are <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd></span>,
<span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd></span>, and <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></span>, which you may find easier to remember.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>U</kbd>
Undoes the last palette editor command.  Will undo all the way to the
beginning of the current session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>E</kbd>
Redoes the undone palette editor commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>F</kbd>
Toggles "Freestyle mode" on and off (Freestyle mode changes a range of
palette values smoothly from a center value outward).  With your cursor
inside the palette box, press the <kbd>F</kbd> key to enter Freestyle mode.  A
default range of colors will be selected for you centered at the cursor
(the ends of the color range are noted by putting dashed lines around
the corresponding palette values).  While in Freestyle mode:</p>

<h3 id="_parameter_saverestore_commands">Parameter Save/Restore Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parameter files can be used to save/restore all options and settings

parameter files are discussed in <a href="#_parameter_files_and_the_command">Parameter Files and the <kbd>@</kbd> Command</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you hit <kbd>@</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd>, Id displays the names of the entries in the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>B</kbd></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <kbd>B</kbd> command saves the parameters required to describe the currently

command to recreate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you press <kbd>B</kbd>, Id prompts for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parameter file:  The name of the file to store the parameters in.  You
should use some name like "myimages" instead of id.par, so that your
images are kept separate from the ones released with new versions of
Id.  You can use the parmfile= command in sstools.ini to set the
default parameter file name to "myimages" or whatever.  (See
<a href="#_setting_defaults_sstools_ini_file">Setting Defaults (sstools.ini File)</a> and "parmfile=" in <a href="#_file_parameters">File Parameters</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name:  The name you want to assign to the entry, to be displayed when
the <kbd>@</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> command is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main comment:  A comment to be shown beside the entry in the <kbd>@</kbd>
command display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, Third, and Fourth comment:  Additional comments to store in
the file with the entry.  These comments go in the file only, and are
not displayed by the <kbd>@</kbd> command.  You can set these comments from the
command line - see <a href="#_startup_parameters">Comment= Command</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record colors?:  Whether color information should be included in the
entry.  Usually the default value displayed by Id is what you want.
Allowed values are:
"no" - Don&#8217;t record colors.
"@mapfilename" - When these parameters are used, load colors from the
   named color map file.  This is the default if you are currently
   using colors from a color map file.
"yes" - Record the colors in detail.  This is the default when you&#8217;ve
   changed the display colors by using the palette editor or by color
   cycling.  The only reason that this isn&#8217;t what Id always does for
   the <kbd>B</kbd> command is that color information can be bulky - up to
   nearly 3K of disk space per map - which adds up to a lot for many
   images.  Smooth-shaded ranges of colors are compressed, so if
   that&#8217;s used a lot in an image the color information won&#8217;t be as
   bulky.
"only" - Record only the colors in the par file, without any other
   parameters.  This is useful for converting color maps to par
   entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p># of colors:  This only matters if "Record colors?" is set to "yes".
It specifies the number of colors to record.  Recording less colors
will take less space.  Usually the default value displayed by Id is
what you want.  You might want to increase it in some cases, e.g. if
you are using a 256 color mode with maxiter 150, and have used the
palette editor to set all 256 possible colors for use with color
cycling, then you&#8217;ll want to set the "# of colors" to 256.  See the
<a href="#_color_parameters">recordcolors</a> command, which controls when mapfiles are used and when
compressed colors are written to par files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maxlinelength: This number controls the maximum width of a parameter
entry in a par file.  The default is 72 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the bottom of the input screen are inputs for Id&#8217;s "pieces" divide-
and-conquer feature.  You can create multiple par entries that break
an image up into pieces so that you can generate the image pieces one
by one.  There are two reasons for doing this.  The first is in case
the fractal is very slow, and you want to generate parts of the image
at the same time on several computers.  The second is that you might
want to make an image greater than 2048 x 2048.  The parameters are:
   X Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the x direction
   Y Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the y direction
   Video mode  - Id video mode for each piece (e.g. "F3")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last item defaults to the current video mode.  If either X
Multiples or Y Multiples are greater than 1, then multiple numbered
par entries for the pieces are added to the par file, and a
makemig.bat file is created that builds all of the component pieces
and then stitches them together into a "multi-image" GIF.  The current
limitations of the "divide and conquer" algorithm are 36 or fewer X
and Y multiples (so you are limited to "only" 36x36=1296 component
images), and a final resolution limit in both the X and Y directions
of 65,535 (a limitation of "only" four billion pixels or so).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final image generated by makemig is a "multi-image" GIF file
called fractmig.gif.  In case you have other software that can&#8217;t
handle multi-image GIF files, makemig includes a final (but commented
out) call to simplgif, a companion program that reads a GIF file that
may contain little tricks like multiple images and creates a simple
GIF from it.  Fair warning: simplgif needs room to build a composite
image while it works, and it does that using a temporary disk file
equal to the size of the final image - and a 64Kx64K GIF image
requires a 4GB temporary disk file!</p>

<li>
<p>Keys which suspend calculation of the current image (if one is being

keys in this group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keys which automatically trigger calculation of a new image.
Examples:  selecting a video mode (e.g. <kbd>F3</kbd>);  selecting a fractal

this group, calculation automatically resumes when you return from
the function (e.g. <kbd>Esc</kbd> from color cycling, <kbd>PageDown</kbd> to clear zoom
box).  There are a few fractal types which cannot resume calculation,
they are noted below.  Note that after saving an image with <kbd>S</kbd>, you

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_view_window">View Window</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <kbd>V</kbd> command is used to set the view window parameters described
below.  These parameters can be used to:
 * Define a small window on the screen which is to contain the generated
   images.  Using a small window speeds up calculation time (there are
   fewer pixels to generate).  You can use a small window to explore
   quickly, then turn the view window off to recalculate the image at
   full screen size.
 * Generate an image with a different "aspect ratio"; e.g. in a square
   window or in a tall skinny rectangle.
 * View saved GIF images which have pixel dimensions different from any
   mode supported by your hardware.  This use of view windows occurs
   automatically when you restore such an image.
 * Define a disk video mode up to 32767x32767.  First select a disk
   video mode using <kbd>Delete</kbd>.  Then on the <kbd>V</kbd> screen enter both an X
   and a Y value at the Virtual Screen Total Pixels prompts.
 * Define a virtual video mode up to the size that fits in memory.
   First select a video mode using <kbd>Delete</kbd>.  Then on the <kbd>V</kbd> screen
   enter both an X and a Y value at the Virtual Screen Total Pixels
   prompts.  The Keep Aspect prompt is used if the asked for virtual
   screen is larger than video memory.  If set, the X and Y values will
   both be reduced such that the ratio between them is maintained.  If
   not set, just the Y value will be reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Preview display"
Set this to "yes" to turn on view window, "no" for full screen display.
While this is "no", the only view parameter which has any affect is
"final media aspect ratio".  When a view window is being used, all other
Id functions continue to operate normally - you can zoom, color-cycle,
and all the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Reduction factor"
When an explicit size is not given, this determines the view window
size, as a factor of the screen size.  For example, a reduction factor
of 2 makes the window 1/2 as big as the screen in both dimensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Final media aspect ratio"
This is the height of the final image you want, divided by the width.
The default is 0.75 because typical video modes have a height:width
ratio of 3:4.  For example, set this to 2.0 for an image twice as high
as it is wide.  The effect of this parameter is visible only when
"preview display" is enabled.  If the explicit size of both x and y are
set, setting this value to 0 will cause the appropriate value to be
calculated based on x and y.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Crop starting coordinates"
This parameter affects what happens when you change the aspect ratio.
If set to "no", then when you change aspect ratio, the prior image will
be squeezed or stretched to fit into the new shape.  If set to "yes",
the prior image is "cropped" to avoid squeezing or stretching.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Explicit size"
Setting these to non-zero values over-rides the "reduction factor" with
explicit sizes in pixels.  If only the "x pixels" size is specified, the
"y pixels" size is calculated automatically based on x and the aspect
ratio.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following option is available when using disk video or virtual
screen modes:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Virtual screen"
Setting these allow defining a virtual screen as large as the available
video memory will permit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following options are available when using virtual screen modes:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Keep aspect"
If this is set, when the asked for virtual screen is larger than video
memory the X and Y values will both be reduced such that the ratio
between them is maintained.  If not set, just the Y value will be
reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Zoombox scrolling"
The fixed setting tries to maintain the zoombox in the center of the
screen by moving the virtual image.  The relaxed setting moves the
virtual image when the zoombox reached the edges of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More about final aspect ratio:  If you want to produce a high quality
hard-copy image which is say 8" high by 5" down, based on a vertical
"slice" of an existing image, you could use a procedure like the
following.  You&#8217;ll need some method of converting a GIF image to your
final media (slide or whatever) - Id can only do the whole job with a
PostScript printer, it does not preserve aspect ratio with other
printers.</p>

<h3 id="_video_mode_function_keys">Video Mode Function Keys</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of a "video mode" in Id is somewhat of a misnomer.  Id is
just another GUI program on your desktop and doesn&#8217;t control the video
display directly.  The size of the video mode determines the pixel
dimenions of any saved images.  So you can think of the "video mode" as
"image size".  In a future release, the saved image size will be
decoupled from the size of the displayed image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The video modes that can be selected are determined entirely from the
settings in the id.cfg file.  See <a href="#_customized_video_modes">_id_cfg</a> to

What you can do is exit the browser, press <kbd>PageUp</kbd> until the zoom box

<h3 id="_hints">Hints</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember, you do NOT have to wait for the program to finish a full
screen display before entering a command.  If you see an interesting
spot you want to zoom in on while the screen is half-done, don&#8217;t wait&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;do it!  If you think after seeing the first few lines that another video
mode would look better, go ahead&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Id will shift modes and start the
redraw at once.  When it finishes a display, it beeps and waits for your
next command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the most interesting areas are the "border" areas where the
colors are changing rapidly.  Zoom in on them for the best results.  The
first Mandelbrot-set (default) fractal image has a large, solid-colored
interior that is the slowest to display; there&#8217;s nothing to be seen by
zooming there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plotting time is directly proportional to the number of pixels in a
screen, and hence increases with the resolution of the video mode.  You
may want to start in a low-resolution mode for quick progress while
zooming in, and switch to a higher-resolution mode when things get
interesting.  Or use the solid guessing mode and pre-empt with a zoom
before it finishes.  Plotting time also varies with the maximum
iteration setting, the fractal type, and your choice of drawing mode.
Solid-guessing (the default) is fastest, but it can be wrong:
perfectionists will want to use dual-pass mode (its first-pass preview
is handy if you might zoom pre-emptively) or single-pass mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you start systematically exploring, you can save time (and hey,

straight to it the next time by using the command id fractxxx (the .gif

<p>Id starts by default with the Mandelbrot set.  You can change that by

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This set is the classic: the only one implemented in many plotting
programs, and the source of most of the printed fractal images
published.  Like most of the other types in Id, it is simply a graph:
the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) coordinate axes represent ranges of
two independent quantities, with various colors used to symbolize levels
of a third quantity which depends on the first two.  So far, so good:
basic analytic geometry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now things get a bit hairier.  The x axis is ordinary, vanilla real
numbers.  The y axis is an imaginary number, i.e. a real number times i,
where i is the square root of -1.  Every point on the plane&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in this
case, Id&#8217;s main window&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;represents a complex number of the form:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>x-coordinate + i * y-coordinate</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your math training stopped before you got to imaginary and complex
numbers, this is not the place to catch up.  Suffice it to say that they
are just as "real" as the numbers you count fingers with (they&#8217;re used
every day by electrical engineers) and they can undergo the same kinds
of algebraic operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, now pick any complex number&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;any point on the complex plane&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and
call it C, a constant.  Pick another, this time one which can vary, and
call it Z.  Starting with Z=0 (i.e., at the origin, where the real and
imaginary axes cross), calculate the value of the expression</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\$Z^2 + C\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take the result, make it the new value of the variable Z, and calculate
again.  Take that result, make it Z, and do it again, and so on: in
mathematical terms, iterate the function \$Z_(n+1) = Z_n^2 + C\$. For
certain values of C, the result "levels off" after a while.  For all
others, it grows without limit.  The Mandelbrot set you see at the start&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the solid-colored lake (blue by default), the blue circles sprouting
from it, and indeed every point of that color&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is the set of all
points C for which the magnitude of Z is less than 2 after 150
iterations (150 is the default setting, changeable via the <kbd>X</kbd> options
screen or "maxiter=" parameter).  All the surrounding "contours" of
other colors represent points for which the magnitude of Z exceeds 2
after 149 iterations (the contour closest to the M-set itself), 148
iterations, (the next one out), and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We actually don&#8217;t test for the magnitude of Z exceeding 2 - we test the
magnitude of Z squared against 4 instead because it is easier.  This
value (FOUR usually) is known as the "bailout" value for the
calculation, because we stop iterating for the point when it is reached.
The bailout value can be changed on the <kbd>Z</kbd> options screen but the
default is usually best.  See also <a href="#_bailout_test">Bailout Test</a>.</p>

<p>Some features of interest:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Use the <kbd>X</kbd> options screen to increase the maximum number of
iterations.  Notice that the boundary of the M-set becomes more and more
convoluted (the technical terms are "wiggly", "squiggly", and "utterly
bizarre") as the Z-magnitudes for points that were still within the set
after 150 iterations turn out to exceed 2 after 200, 500, or 1200.  In
fact, it can be proven that the true boundary is infinitely long: detail
without limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although there appear to be isolated "islands" of blue, zoom in&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, plot for a smaller range of coordinates to show more detail&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and you&#8217;ll see that there are fine "causeways" of blue connecting them
to the main set.  As you zoomed, smaller islands became visible; the
same is true for them.  In fact, there are no isolated points in the M-
set: it is "connected" in a strict mathematical sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The upper and lower halves of the first image are symmetric (a fact
that Id makes use of here and in some other fractal types to speed
plotting).  But notice that the same general features&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;lobed discs,
spirals, starbursts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;tend to repeat themselves (although never
exactly) at smaller and smaller scales, so that it can be impossible to
judge by eye the scale of a given image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a sense, the contour colors are window-dressing: mathematically,
it is the properties of the M-set itself that are interesting, and no
information about it would be lost if all points outside the set were
assigned the same color.  If you&#8217;re a serious, no-nonsense type, you may
want to cycle the colors just once to see the kind of silliness that
other people enjoy, and then never do it again.  Go ahead.  Just once,
now.  We trust you.</p>

<p>These sets were named for mathematician Gaston Julia, and can be
generated by a simple change in the iteration process described for the
<a href="#_the_mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot Set</a>.  Start with a specified value of C, "C-real + i * C-

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a Julia set corresponding to every point on the complex plane&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an infinite number of Julia sets.  But the most visually interesting
tend to be found for the same C values where the M-set image is busiest,
i.e.  points just outside the boundary.  Go too far inside, and the
corresponding Julia set is a circle; go too far outside, and it breaks
up into scattered points.  In fact, all Julia sets for C within the M-
set share the "connected" property of the M-set, and all those for C
outside lack it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id&#8217;s spacebar toggle lets you "flip" between any view of the M-set and
the Julia set for the point C at the center of that screen.  You can
then toggle back, or zoom your way into the Julia set for a while and
then return to the M-set.  So if the infinite complexity of the M-set
palls, remember: each of its infinite points opens up a whole new Julia
set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Historically, the Julia sets came first: it was while looking at the M-
set as an "index" of all the Julia sets' origins that Mandelbrot noticed
its properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The relationship between the <a href="#_the_mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot</a> set and Julia set can hold
between other sets as well.  Many of Id&#8217;s types are "Mandelbrot/Julia"
pairs&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sometimes called "M-sets" or "J-sets".  All these are generated
by equations that are of the form \$z_(k+1) = f(z_(k),c)\$, where the
function orbit is the sequence \$z_(0)\$, \$z_(1)\$, \$...\$,
and the variable c is a complex parameter of the equation.  The value c
is fixed for "Julia" sets and is equal to the first two parameters
entered with the "params=Creal/Cimag" command.  The initial orbit value
z(0) is the complex number corresponding to the screen pixel.  For
Mandelbrot sets, the parameter c is the complex number corresponding to
the screen pixel.  The value \$z_(0)\$ is c plus a perturbation equal
to the values of the first two parameters.  See the discussion of
<a href="#_mandellambda_sets">Mandellambda Sets</a>.  This approach may or may not be the "standard" way
to create "Mandelbrot" sets out of "Julia" sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some equations have additional parameters.  These values are entered as
the third or fourth params= value for both Julia and Mandelbrot sets.
The variables x and y refer to the real and imaginary parts of z;
similarly, cx and cy are the real and imaginary parts of the parameter c
and fx(z) and fy(z) are the real and imaginary parts of f(z).  The
variable c is sometimes called lambda for historical reasons.</p>

<h3 id="_inverse_julias">Inverse Julias</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(type=julia_inverse)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pick a function, such as the familiar \$Z_(n) = Z_(n-1) + C\$ (the
defining function of the Mandelbrot Set).  If you pick a point
\$Z_0\$ at random from the complex plane, and repeatedly apply the
function to it, you get a sequence of new points called an orbit, which
usually either zips out toward infinity or zooms in toward one or more
"attractor" points near the middle of the plane.  The set of all points
that are "attracted" to infinity is called the "basin of attraction" of
infinity.  Each of the other attractors also has its own basin of
attraction.  Why is it called a basin?  Imagine a lake, and all the
water in it "draining" into the attractor.  The boundary between these
basins is called the Julia Set of the function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The boundary between the basins of attraction is sort of like a
repeller; all orbits move away from it, toward one of the attractors.
But if we define a new function as the inverse of the old one, as for
instance \$Z_(n) = sqrt(Z_(n-1) - C)\$, then the old attractors
become repellers, and the former boundary itself becomes the attractor!
Now, starting from any point, all orbits are drawn irresistibly to the
Julia Set!  In fact, once an orbit reaches the boundary, it will
continue to hop about until it traces the entire Julia Set!  This method
for drawing Julia Sets is called the Inverse Iteration Method, or IIM
for short.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, some parts of each Julia Set boundary are far more
attractive to inverse orbits than others are, so that as an orbit traces
out the set, it keeps coming back to these attractive parts again and
again, only occasionally visiting the less attractive parts.  Thus it
may take an infinite length of time to draw the entire set.  To hasten
the process, we can keep track of how many times each pixel on our
computer screen is visited by an orbit, and whenever an orbit reaches a
pixel that has already been visited more than a certain number of times,
we can consider that orbit finished and move on to another one.  This
"hit limit" thus becomes similar to the iteration limit used in the
traditional escape-time fractal algorithm.  This is called the Modified
Inverse Iteration Method, or MIIM, and is much faster than the IIM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the inverse of Mandelbrot&#8217;s classic function is a square root, and
the square root actually has two solutions; one positive, one negative.
Therefore at each step of each orbit of the inverse function there is a
decision; whether to use the positive or the negative square root.  Each
one gives rise to a new point on the Julia Set, so each is a good
choice.  This series of choices defines a binary decision tree, each
point on the Julia Set giving rise to two potential child points.  There
are many interesting ways to traverse a binary tree, among them breadth
first, depth first (left or negative first), depth first (right or
positive first), and completely at random.  It turns out that most
traversal methods lead to the same or similar pictures, but that how the
image evolves as the orbits trace it out differs wildly depending on the
traversal method chosen.  As far as we know, this fact is an original
discovery by Michael Snyder, and version 18.2 of Id&#8217;s ancestor,
Fractint, was its first publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pick a Julia constant such as \$Z_(0)\$ = (-.74543, .11301), the
popular Seahorse Julia, and try drawing it first breadth first, then
depth first (right first), depth first (left first), and finally with
random walk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Caveats: the video memory is used in the algorithm, to keep track of how
many times each pixel has been visited (by changing it&#8217;s color).
Therefore the algorithm will not work well if you zoom in far enough
that part of the Julia Set is off the screen.</p>
</div>

<p>This method has the limitation that it does not work with disk video
modes and it is not resumable.</p>

<h3 id="_ant_automaton">Ant Automaton</h3>

<p>(type=ant)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This fractal type is the generalized ant automaton described in the
"Computer Recreations" column of the July 1994 Scientific American.  The
article attributes this automaton to Greg Turk of Stanford University,
Leonid A.  Bunivomitch of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and S. E.
Troubetzkoy of the University of Bielefeld.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ant wanders around the screen, starting at the middle.  A rule
string, which the user can input as Id&#8217;s first parameter, determines the
ant&#8217;s direction.  This rule string is stored as a double precision
number in our implementation.  Only the digit 1 is significant&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all
other digits are treated as 0.  When the type 1 ant leaves a cell (a
pixel on the screen) of color k, it turns right if the kth symbol in the
rule string is a 1, or left otherwise.  Then the color in the abandoned
cell is incremented.  The type 2 ant uses only the rule string to move
around.  If the digit of the rule string is a 1, the ant turns right and
puts a zero in current cell, otherwise it turns left and put a number in
the current cell.  An empty rule string causes the rule to be generated
randomly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id&#8217;s 2nd parameter is a maximum iteration to guarantee that the fractal
will terminate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 3rd parameter is the number of ants (up to 256).  If you select 0
ants, then the number of ants is random.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 4th paramter allows you to select ant type 1 (the original), or type
2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 5th parameter determines whether the ant&#8217;s progress stops when the
edge of the screen is reaches (as in the original implementation), or
whether the ant&#8217;s path wraps to the opposite side of the screen.  You
can slow down the ant to see her better using the <kbd>P</kbd> screen orbit delay
- try 10.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 6th parameter accepts a random seed, allowing you to duplicate
images using random values (empty rule string or 0 maximum ants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try rule string 10.  In this case, the ant moves in a seemingly random
pattern, then suddenly marches off in a straight line.  This happens for
many other rule strings.  The default 1100 produces symmetrical images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the screen initially contains an image, the path of the ant changes.
To try this, generate a fractal, and press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></span>.  Note that images
seeded with an image are not (yet) reproducible in PAR files.  When
started using the <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></span> keys, after the ant is finished the default
fractal type reverts to that of the underlying fractal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Special keystrokes are in effect during the ant&#8217;s march.  The <kbd>Space</kbd>
key toggles a step-by-step mode.  When in this mode, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to
see each step of the ant&#8217;s progress.  When orbit delay (on <kbd>P</kbd> screen)
is set to 1, the step mode is the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you press the right or left arrow during the ant&#8217;s journey, you can
adjust the orbit delay factor with the arrow keys (increment by 10) or
<span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd></span> keys (increment by 100).  Press any other key to get out of
the orbit delay adjustment mode.  Higher values cause slower motion.

<p>One of the most remarkable spin-offs of fractal geometry is the ability

(default is id.ifs, a set of definitions supplied with Id) for IFS
definitions, then prompts you for the IFS name you wish to run.  Fern

<p>Note that some Barnsley IFS values generate images quite a bit smaller

it on the small image, and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get a full-screen image.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To change the number of dots Id generates for an IFS image before

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id supports two types of IFS images: 2D and 3D.  In order to fully
appreciate 3D IFS images, since your monitor is presumably 2D, we have
added rotation, translation, and perspective capabilities.  These share
values with the same variables used in Id&#8217;s other 3D facilities; for
their meaning see <a href="#_rectangular_coordinate_transformation">Rectangular Coordinate Transformation</a>.  You can enter
these values from the command line using:</p>

<p>Alternatively, entering <kbd>I</kbd> from main screen will allow you to modify
these values.  The defaults are the same as for regular 3D, and are not

changes the picture&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;your "point of view" is moved.</p>

<p>Michael Barnsley has written a fascinating college-level text, "Fractals

<p>We have incorporated three of Barnsley&#8217;s examples in Id.  Their
appearance suggests polarized-light microphotographs of minerals, with

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wonder of fractal geometry is that such complex forms can arise from
such simple generating processes.  A parallel surprise has emerged in
the study of dynamical systems: that simple, deterministic equations can
yield chaotic behavior, in which the system never settles down to a
steady state or even a periodic loop.  Often such systems behave
normally up to a certain level of some controlling parameter, then go
through a transition in which there are two possible solutions, then
four, and finally a chaotic array of possibilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This emerged many years ago in biological models of population growth.
Consider a (highly over-simplified) model in which the rate of growth is
partly a function of the size of the current population:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\$P_(n+1) = r P_n (1 - P_n)\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where population is normalized to be between 0 and 1.  At growth rates
less than 200 percent, this model is stable: for any starting value,
after several generations the population settles down to a stable level.
But for rates over 200 percent, the equation&#8217;s curve splits or
"bifurcates" into two discrete solutions, then four, and soon becomes
chaotic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type=bifurcation illustrates this model. (Although it&#8217;s now considered a
poor one for real populations, it helped get people thinking about
chaotic systems.)  The horizontal axis represents growth rates, from 190
percent (far left) to 400 percent; the vertical axis normalized
population values, from 0 to 4/3.  Notice that within the chaotic
region, there are narrow bands where there is a small, odd number of
stable values.  It turns out that the geometry of this branching is
fractal; zoom in where changing pixel colors look suspicious, and see
for yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Three parameters apply to bifurcations: Filter Cycles, Seed Population,
and Function or Beta.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Filter Cycles (default 1000) is the number of iterations to be done
before plotting maxiter population values.  This gives the iteration
time to settle into the characteristic patterns that constitute the
bifurcation diagram, and results in a clean-looking plot.  However,
using lower values produces interesting results too.  Set Filter Cycles
to 1 for an unfiltered map.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seed Population (default 0.66) is the initial population value from
which all others are calculated.  For filtered maps the final image is
independent of Seed Population value in the valid range (0.0 &lt; Seed
Population &lt; 1.0).
Seed Population becomes effective in unfiltered maps - try setting
Filter Cycles to 1 (unfiltered) and Seed Population to 0.001
("params=1/.001" on the command line).  This results in a map overlaid
with nice curves.  Each Seed Population value results in a different set
of curves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Function (default "ident") is the function applied to the old population
before the new population is determined.  The "ident" function
calculates the same bifurcation fractal that was generated before these
formulae were generalized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beta is used in the bifmay bifurcations and is the power to which the
denominator is raised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that Id normally uses periodicity checking to speed up bifurcation
computation.  However, in some cases a better quality image will be
obtained if you turn off periodicity checking with "periodicity=no"; for
instance, if you use a high number of iterations and a smooth colormap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many formulae can be used to produce bifurcations.  Mitchel Feigenbaum
studied lots of bifurcations in the mid-70&#8217;s, using a HP-65 calculator
(Personal computers, fractals, and Id, were all science fiction then!).
He studied where bifurcations occurred, for the formula \$r P(1-P)\$
the one described above.  He found that the ratios of lengths of
adjacent areas of bifurcation were four and a bit.  These ratios vary,
but, as the growth rate increases, they tend to a limit of 4.669+.  This
helped him guess where bifurcation points would be, and saved lots of
time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When he studied bifurcations of \$r sin(pi P)\$ he found a similar
pattern, which is not surprising in itself.  However, 4.669+ popped out,
again.  Different formulae, same number?  Now, that&#8217;s surprising!  He
tried many other formulae and always got 4.669+ - Hot Damn!!!  So hot,
in fact, that he phoned home and told his mom it would make him famous!
He also went on to tell other scientists.  The rest is history&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(It has been conjectured that if Feigenbaum had a copy of Id, and used
it to study bifurcations, he may never have found his number, as it only
became obvious from long perusal of hand-written lists of values,
without the distraction of wild color-cycling effects!).
We now know that this number is as universal as pi or e, the base of the
natural logarithm.  It appears in situations ranging from fluid-flow
turbulence, electronic oscillators, chemical reactions, and even the
Mandelbrot Set - yup, fraid so: "budding" of the Mandelbrot Set along
the negative real axis occurs at intervals determined by Feigenbaum&#8217;s
constant, 4.669201660910&#8230;&#8203;..</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id does not make direct use of the Feigenbaum constant (yet!).  However,
it does now reflect the fact that there is a whole sub-species of
bifurcation-type fractals.  Those implemented to date, and the related
formulae,(writing \$P_(n+1)\$ for pop[n+1] and \$P_n\$ for pop[n])
are:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These fractals are generated by 1-dimensional cellular automata.
Consider a 1-dimensional line of cells, where each cell can have the
value 0 or 1.  In each time step, the new value of a cell is computed
from the old value of the cell and the values of its neighbors.  On the
screen, each horizontal row shows the value of the cells at any one
time.  The time axis proceeds down the screen, with each row computed
from the row above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different classes of cellular automata can be described by how many
different states a cell can have (k), and how many neighbors on each
side are examined (r).  Id implements the binary nearest neighbor
cellular automata (k=2,r=1), the binary next-nearest neighbor cellular
automata (k=2,r=2), and the ternary nearest neighbor cellular automata
(k=3,r=1) and several others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rules used here determine the next state of a given cell by using
the sum of the states in the cell&#8217;s neighborhood.  The sum of the cells
in the neighborhood are mapped by rule to the new value of the cell.
For the binary nearest neighbor cellular automata, only the closest
neighbor on each side is used.  This results in a 4 digit rule
controlling the generation of each new line:  if each of the cells in
the neighborhood is 1, the maximum sum is 1+1+1 = 3 and the sum can
range from 0 to 3, or 4 values.  This results in a 4 digit rule.  For
instance, in the rule 1010, starting from the right we have 0&#8594;0, 1&#8594;1,
2&#8594;0, 3&#8594;1.  If the cell&#8217;s neighborhood sums to 2, the new cell value
would be 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the next-nearest cellular automata (kr = 22), each pixel is
determined from the pixel value and the two neighbors on each side.
This results in a 6 digit rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the ternary nearest neighbor cellular automata (kr = 31), each cell
can have the value 0, 1, or 2.  A single neighbor on each side is
examined, resulting in a 7 digit rule.</p>

<p>Fascinating Moire patterns can be formed by calculating \$x^2 + y^2\$
for each pixel in a piece of the complex plane.  After multiplication by
a magnification factor (the parameter), the number is truncated to an
integer and mapped to a color via color = value modulo (number of
colors).  That is, the integer is divided by the number of colors, and
the remainder is the color index value used.  The resulting image is not
a fractal because all detail is lost after zooming in too far.  Try it

<div class="paragraph">
<p>(type=diffusion)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Standard diffusion begins with a single point in the center of the
screen.  Subsequent points move around randomly until coming into
contact with a point already on the screen, at which time their
locations are fixed and they are drawn.  This process repeats until the
fractals reaches the edge of the screen.  Use the show orbits function
to see the points' random motion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One unfortunate problem is that on a large screen, this process will
tend to take eons.  To speed things up, the points are restricted to a
box around the initial point.  The first parameter to diffusion contains
the size of the border between the fractal and the edge of the box.  If
you make this number small, the fractal will look more solid and will be
generated more quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second parameter to diffusion changes the type of growth.  If you
set it to 1, then the diffusion will start with a line along the bottom
of the screen.  Points will appear above this line and the fractal will
grow upward.  For this fractal, the points are restricted to a box which
is as wide as the screen but whose distance from the fractal is given by
the border size (the first parameter).  Initial points are released from
a centered segment along the top of this box which has a width equal to
twice the border size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the second parameter is set to 2, then diffusion begins with a square
box on the screen.  Points appear on a circle inside the box whose
distance from the box is equal to the border size.  This fractal grows
very slowly since the points are not restricted to a small box.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third and last parameter for diffusion controls the color of the
fractal.  If it is set to zero then points are colored randomly.
Otherwise, it tells how often to shift the color of the points being
deposited.  If you set it to 150, for example, then the color of the
points will shift every 150 points leading to a radial color pattern if
you are using the standards diffusion type.</p>

<p>These fractals are based on a cyclic system of differential equations:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:
(x'(t)=-f(y(t))),(y'(t)=f(x(t)))
:}\$
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These equations are approximated by using a small time step dt, forming
a time-discrete dynamic system:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:
(x_(n+1) = x_n - "dt" f(y_n)),
(y_(n+1) = y_n + "dt" f(x_n))
:}\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initial values x(0) and y(0) are set to various points in the plane,
the dynamic system is iterated, and the resulting orbit points are
plotted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Id, the function f is restricted to:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:
f(k) = sin(k + a "fn1"(b k))
:}\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parameters are the spacing of the initial points, the time step dt,
and the parameters (a,b,fn1) that affect the function f.  Normally the
orbit points are plotted individually, but for a negative spacing the
points are connected.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This fractal is similar to the <a href="#_pickover_popcorn">Pickover Popcorn</a>.
A variant is the implicit Euler approximation:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:
(y_(n+1) = y_n + "dt" f(x_n)),
(x_(n+1) = x_n - "dt" f(y_(n+1)))

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This variant results in complex orbits.  The implicit Euler
approximation is selected by entering dt &lt; 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two options that have unusual effects on these fractals.  The
orbit delay value controls how many initial points are computed before
the orbits are displayed on the screen.  This allows the orbit to settle
down.  The outside=summ option causes each pixel to increment color
every time an orbit touches it; the resulting display is a 2-d
histogram.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These unique variations on the Julia set theme, presented in "The
Science of Fractal Images", challenge us to expand our pre-conceived
notions of how fractals should be iterated.  We start with a very basic
Julia formula:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\$z_(n+1) = z_(n)^2 + (0, 0i)\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standard algorithm would test each iterated point to see if it
"escapes to infinity".  If its size or "modulus" (its distance from the
origin) exceeds a preselected <a href="#_bailout_test">Bailout Test</a> value, it is outside the
Julia set, and it is banished to the world of multicolored level sets
which color-cycle spectacularly.  But another way of describing an
escaped point is to say that it is "attracted" to infinity.  We make
this decision by calculating whether the point falls within the "target
set" of all points closer to infinity than the boundary created by the
bailout value.  In this way, the "disk around infinity" is conceptually
no different from the disks around <a href="#_finite_attractors">Finite Attractors</a> such as those used
for Newton fractals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above formula, with \$c = (0, 0i)\$, this standard algorithm
yields a rather unexciting circle.  But along comes Peitgen to tell us
that "since T [the target set] can essentially be anything, this method
has tremendous artistic potential.  For example, T could be a so-called
p-norm disk &#8230;&#8203; or a scaled filled-in Julia set or something designed by
hand.  This method opens a simple [beware when he uses words like that]
and systematic approach to Escher-like tilings."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what we do is iterate the above formula, scale each iteration, and
plug it into a second Julia formula.  This formula has a value of c
selected by the user.  If the point converges to this non-circular
target set:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\$T = { z: |(15.0 z)^2 + c| &lt; "BAILOUT" }\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>we color it in proportion to the overall iteration count.  If not, it
will be attracted to infinity and can be colored with the usual outside
coloring options.  This formula uses an Id programming feature which
allows the use of a customized coloring option for the points which
converge to the target Julia set, yet allows the other points to be
handled by the standard fractal engine with all of its options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the proper palette and parameters for c, and using the <a href="#_inversion">Inversion</a>
option and a solid outside color from the <a href="#_color_parameters">Color Parameters</a>, you can
create a solar eclipse, with the corona composed of Julia-shaped flames
radiating from the sun&#8217;s surface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you question the relevance of these images to Escher, check out his
Circle Limit series (especially III and IV).  In his own words: "It is
to be doubted whether there exist today many &#8230;&#8203; artists of any kind, to
whom the desire has come to penetrate to the depths of infinity&#8230;&#8203;.
There is only one possible way of &#8230;&#8203; obtaining an "infinity" entirely
enclosed within a logical boundary line&#8230;&#8203;.  The largest &#8230;&#8203; shapes are
now found in the center and the limit of infinite number and infinite
smallness is reached at the circumference&#8230;&#8203;.  Not one single component
ever reaches the edge.  For beyond that there is "absolute nothingness."
And yet this round world cannot exist without the emptiness around it,
not simply because "within" presupposes "without", but also because it
is out there in the "nothingness" that the center points of the arcs
that go to build up the framework are fixed with such geometric
exactitude."</p>

<p>This is a "roll-your-own" fractal interpreter - you don&#8217;t even need a

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To run a "type=formula" fractal, you first need a text file containing
formulas (there&#8217;s a sample file - id.frm - included with this
distribution).  When you select the "formula" fractal type, Id scans the
current formula file (default is id.frm) for formulas, then prompts you
for the formula name you wish to run.  After prompting for any
parameters, the formula is parsed for syntax errors and then the fractal
is generated.  If you want to use a different formula file, press <kbd>F6</kbd>
when you are prompted to select a formula name.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two command-line options that work with type=formula
("formulafile=" and "formulaname="), useful when you are using this

<p>Frothy basins, or riddled basins, were discovered by James C. Alexander
of the University of Maryland.  The discussion below is derived from a

<p>One of the things that makes this fractal so interesting is the shape of
the dynamical system&#8217;s attractors.  It is not at all uncommon for a
dynamical system to have non-point attractors.  Shapes such as circles
are very common.  Strange attractors are attractors which are themselves
fractal.  What is unusual about this system, however, is that the
attractors intersect.  This is the first case in which such a phenomenon
has been observed.  The attractors for this system are made up of line
segments which overlap to form an equilateral triangle.  This attractor
triangle can be seen by using the "show orbits" option (the <kbd>O</kbd> key) or
the "orbits window" option (the <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd></span> key).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The number of attractors present is dependant on the value of A, the
imaginary part of C.  For values where A &#8656; 1.028713768218725&#8230;&#8203;, there
are three attractors.  When A is larger than this critical value, two of
attractors merge into one, leaving only two attractors.  An interesting
variation on this fractal can be generated by applying the above mapping
twice per each iteration.  The result is that some of the attractors are
split into two parts, giving the system either six or three attractors,
depending on whether A is less than or greater than the critical value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are also called "riddled basins" because each basin is riddled
with holes.  Which attractor a point is eventually pulled into is
extremely sensitive to its initial position.  A very slight change in
any direction may cause it to end up on a different attractor.  As a
result, the basins are thoroughly intermingled.  The effect appears to
be a frothy mixture that has been subjected to lots of stirring and
folding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pixel color is determined by which attractor captures the orbit.  The
shade of color is determined by the number of iterations required to
capture the orbit.  In Id, the actual shade of color used depends on how
many colors are available in the video mode being used.  If 256 colors
are available, the default coloring scheme is determined by the number
of iterations that were required to capture the orbit.  An alternative
coloring scheme can be used where the shade is determined by the
iterations required divided by the maximum iterations.  This method is
especially useful on deeply zoomed images.  If only 16 colors are
available, then only the alternative coloring scheme is used.  If fewer
than 16 colors are available, then Id just colors the basins without any
shading.</p>

<p>The Halley map is an algorithm used to find the roots of polynomial
equations by successive "guesses" that converge on the correct value as
you feed the results of each approximation back into the formula.  It
works very well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;unless you are unlucky enough to pick a value that is
on a line between two actual roots.  In that case, the sequence explodes
into chaos, with results that diverge more and more wildly as you
continue the iteration.</p>

for a parameter, the "order" of the equation (an integer from 2 through
10&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;2 for \$z (z^2 - 1)\$, 7 for \$z (z^7 - 1)\$, etc.).  A
second parameter is the relaxation coefficient, and is used to control
the convergence stability.  A number greater than one increases the
chaotic behavior and a number less than one decreases the chaotic
behavior.  The third parameter is the value used to determine when the
formula has converged.  The test for convergence is \$||z(n+1)|^2 -
|z(n)|^2| &lt; epsilon\$. This convergence test produces the whisker-like
projections which generally point to a root.</p>

He came to the subject of fractals via investigations of the orbits of

of discrete mathematics - difference equations.  The Henon map is an
example of a very simple dynamic system that exhibits strange behavior.
The orbit traces out a characteristic banana shape, but on close
inspection, the shape is made up of thicker and thinner parts.  Upon
magnification, the thicker bands resolve to still other thick and thin

<p>These fractals are based on hypercomplex numbers, which like quaternions
are a four dimensional generalization of complex numbers.  It is not
possible to fully generalize the complex numbers to four dimensions
without sacrificing some of the algebraic properties shared by real and
complex numbers.  Quaternions violate the commutative law of
multiplication, which says \$z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1\$. Hypercomplex
numbers fail the rule that says all non-zero elements have
multiplicative inverses - that is, if z is not 0, there should be a
number \$1/z\$ such that \$(1/z)z = 1\$. This law holds most of
the time but not all the time for hypercomplex numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However hypercomplex numbers have a wonderful property for fractal
purposes.  Every function defined for complex numbers has a simple
generalization to hypercomplex numbers.  Id&#8217;s implementation takes
advantage of this by using "fn" variables - the iteration formula is
\$h_(n+1) = "fn"(h_n) + c\$. where "fn" is the hypercomplex
generalization of sin, cos, log, sqr etc.
You can see 3D versions of these fractals using fractal type Julibrot.
Hypercomplex numbers were brought to our attention by Clyde Davenport,

<p>The Julibrot fractal type uses a general-purpose renderer for
visualizing three dimensional solid fractals.  Originally Mark Peterson
developed this rendering mechanism to view a 3-D sections of a 4-D
structure he called a "Julibrot".  This structure, also called "layered
Julia set" in the fractal literature, hinges on the relationship between
the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.  Each Julia set is created using a fixed
value c in the iterated formula z^2 + c.  The Julibrot is created by
layering Julia sets in the x-y plane and continuously varying c,
creating new Julia sets as z is incremented.  The solid shape thus
created is rendered by shading the surface using a brightness inversely
proportional to the virtual viewer&#8217;s eye.</p>

comes from the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem.  This theorem is a
result in dynamical systems about the persistence of quasiperiodic
motions under small perturbations.  The problem is whether or not a
small perturbation of a conservative dynamical system results in a
lasting quasiperiodic orbit.  The original breakthrough to this problem
was given by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1954.  This was rigorously proved and
extended by Jurgen Moser in 1962 (for smooth twist maps) and Vladimir
Arnold in 1963 (for analytic Hamiltonian systems), and the general
result is known as the KAM theorem.  Quasiperiodic orbits are more
affectionatly known as chaotic orbits!  (Thanks, Wikipedia!)</p>

<p>In 1968, the Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer developed a formal
language for describing the growth of plant cell structures.
Lindenmayer used his formal language to describe the growth patterns of
various types of algae.  Later, the formal language was used to describe
the branching structures of higher plants.  The work was popularized
among fractal enthusiasts in the book "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants"
(1990), by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer.
Lindenmayer died in 1989, but his work was continued and extended by
Prusinkiewicz whose main work consists of using Lindenmayer grammars to
model plant growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Lindenmayer system, or L-system for short, consists of a set of
symbols, a grammar, an interpretation scheme for the symbols and an
initial string of symbols, called the axiom.  The interpretation scheme
operates on a string of symbols to create a picture.  The grammar says
how symbols in the string are replaced in each generation of the system.
Starting with the initial string of symbols, the rules of the grammar
are applied to all the symbols in the string to produce a new string of
symbols.  Each application of the grammar rules is called a generation.
Well, that&#8217;s enough theory!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These fractals are constructed from line segments using rules specified
in drawing commands.  Starting with an initial string, the axiom,
transformation rules are applied a specified number of times, to produce
the final command string which is used to draw the image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like the type=formula fractals, this type requires a separate data file.
A sample file, id.l, is included with this distribution.  When you
select type lsystem, the current L-system file is read and you are asked
for the L-system name you wish to run.  Press <kbd>F6</kbd> at this point if you
wish to use a different L-system file.  After selecting an L-system, you
are asked for one parameter - the "order", or number of times to execute
all the transformation rules.  It is wise to start with small orders,
because the size of the substituted command string grows exponentially
and it is very easy to exceed your resolution.  (Higher orders take
longer to generate too.)  The command line options "lname=" and "lfile="
can be used to over-ride the default file name and L-system name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each L-system entry in the file contains a specification of the angle,
the axiom, and the transformation rules.  Each item must appear on its
own line and each line must be less than 160 characters long.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statement "angle n" sets the angle to 360/n degrees; n must be an
integer greater than two and less than fifty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Axiom string" defines the axiom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transformation rules are specified as "a=string" and convert the single
character 'a' into "string."  If more than one rule is specified for a
single character all of the strings will be added together.  This allows
specifying transformations longer than the 160 character limit.
Transformation rules may operate on any characters except space, tab or

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Lorenz attractor" is a "simple" set of three deterministic
equations developed by Edward Lorenz while studying the non-
repeatability of weather patterns.  The weather forecaster&#8217;s basic
problem is that even very tiny changes in initial patterns ("the beating
of a butterfly&#8217;s wings" - the official term is "sensitive dependence on
initial conditions") eventually reduces the best weather forecast to
rubble.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Lorenz attractor is the plot of the orbit of a dynamic system
consisting of three first order non-linear differential equations.  The
solution to the differential equation is vector-valued function of one
variable.  If you think of the variable as time, the solution traces an
orbit.  The orbit is made up of two spirals at an angle to each other in
three dimensions.  We change the orbit color as time goes on to add a
little dazzle to the image.  The equations are:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:
(dx/dt = -a x + a y),
(dy/dt = b x - y - z x),
(dz/dt = -c z + x y)
:}\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We solve these differential equations approximately using a method known
as the first order taylor series.  Calculus teachers everywhere will
kill us for saying this, but you treat the notation for the derivative
dx/dt as though it really is a fraction, with "dx" the small change in x
that happens when the time changes "dt".  So multiply through the above
equations by dt, and you will have the change in the orbit for a small
time step.  We add these changes to the old vector to get the new vector
after one step.  This gives us:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:
(x_("new") = x - a x dt + a y dt),
(y_("new") = y + b x dt - y dt - x z dt)

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We connect the successive points with a line, project the resulting 3D
orbit onto the screen, and voila!  The Lorenz attractor!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have added two versions of the Lorenz attractor.  "Type=lorenz" is
the Lorenz attractor as seen in everyday 2D.  "Type=lorenz3d" is the
same set of equations with the added twist that the results are run
through our perspective 3D routines, so that you get to view it from
different angles (you can modify your perspective "on the fly" by using
the <kbd>I</kbd> command.)  If you set the "stereo" option to "2", and have
red/blue funny glasses on, you will see the attractor orbit with depth
perception.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hint: the default perspective values (x = 60, y = 30, z = 0) aren&#8217;t the
best ones to use for fun Lorenz attractor viewing.  Experiment a bit -
start with rotation values of 0/0/0 and then change to 20/0/0 and 40/0/0
to see the attractor from different angles.- and while you&#8217;re at it, use
a non-zero perspective point.  Try 100 and see what happens when you get
<strong>inside</strong> the Lorenz orbits.  Here comes one - Duck!  While you are at
it, turn on the sound with the "X".  This way you&#8217;ll at least hear it
coming!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different Lorenz attractors can be created using different parameters.
Four parameters are used.  The first is the time-step (dt).  The default
value is .02.  A smaller value makes the plotting go slower; a larger
value is faster but rougher.  A line is drawn to connect successive
orbit values.  The 2nd, third, and fourth parameters are coefficients
used in the differential equation (a, b, and c).  The default values are
5, 15, and 1.  Try changing these a little at a time to see the result.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bifurcation fractal illustrates what happens in a simple population
model as the growth rate increases.  The Lyapunov fractal expands that
model into two dimensions by letting the growth rate vary in a periodic
fashion between two values.  Each pair of growth rates is run through a
logistic population model and a value called the Lyapunov exponent is
calculated for each pair and is plotted.  The Lyapunov exponent is
calculated by adding up \$log(|r-2rx|)\$ over many cycles of the
population model and dividing by the number of cycles.  Negative
Lyapunov exponents indicate a stable, periodic behavior and are plotted
in color.  Positive Lyapunov exponents indicate chaos (or a diverging
model) and are colored black.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Order parameter:
Each possible periodic sequence yields a two dimensional space to
explore.  The order parameter selects a sequence.  The default value 0
represents the sequence ab which alternates between the two values of
the growth parameter.  On the screen, the a values run vertically and
the b values run horizontally.  Here is how to calculate the space
parameter for any desired sequence.  Take your sequence of a&#8217;s and b&#8217;s
and arrange it so that it starts with at least 2 a&#8217;s and ends with a b.
It may be necessary to rotate the sequence or swap a&#8217;s and b&#8217;s.  Strike
the first a and the last b off the list and replace each remaining a
with a 1 and each remaining b with a zero.  Interpret this as a binary
number and convert it into decimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example:
I like sonnets.  A sonnet is a poem with fourteen lines that has the
following rhyming sequence: abba abba abab cc.  Ignoring the rhyming
couplet at the end, let&#8217;s calculate the order parameter for this
pattern.</p>

<pre>512+64+32+8+2 = 618</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An order parameter of 618 gives the Lyapunov equivalent of a sonnet.
"How do I make thee?  Let me count the ways&#8230;&#8203;"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Population Seed:
When two parts of a Lyapunov overlap, which spike overlaps which is
strongly dependent on the initial value of the population model.  Any
changes from using a different starting value between 0 and 1 may be
subtle.  The values 0 and 1 are interpreted in a special manner.  A seed
of 1 will choose a random number between 0 and 1 at the start of each
pixel.  A seed of 0 will suppress resetting the seed value between
pixels unless the population model diverges in which case a random seed
will be used on the next pixel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Filter Cycles:
Like the Bifurcation model, the Lyapunov allow you to set the number of
cycles that will be run to allow the model to approach equilibrium
before the lyapunov exponent calculation is begun.  The default value of
0 uses one half of the iterations before beginning the calculation of
the exponent.</p>

<p>These fractals use formulae derived from the study of hierarchical
lattices, in the context of magnetic renormalisation transformations.
This kinda stuff is useful in an area of theoretical physics that deals
with magnetic phase-transitions (predicting at which temperatures a
given substance will be magnetic, or non-magnetic).  In an attempt to
clarify the results obtained for real temperatures (the kind that you
and I can feel), the study moved into the realm of complex numbers,
aiming to spot real phase-transitions by finding the intersections of
lines representing complex phase-transitions with the real axis.  The
first people to try this were two physicists called Yang and Lee, who
found the situation a bit more complex than first expected, as the phase
boundaries for complex temperatures are (surprise!) fractals.</p>

<p>In Id terms, the important bits of the above are "fractals", "complex
numbers", "formulae", and "The Beauty of Fractals".  Lifting the
formulae straight out of the book and iterating them over the complex
plane (just like the Mandelbrot set) produces fractals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The formulae are a bit more complicated than the \$z^2+c\$ used for
the Mandelbrot set, that&#8217;s all.  They are :</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These aren&#8217;t quite as horrific as they look (oh yeah ?!) as they only
involve two variables (z and c), but cubing things, doing division, and
eventually squaring the result (all in complex numbers) don&#8217;t exactly
spell s-p-e-e-d !  These are not the fastest fractals in Id!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you might expect, for both formulae there is a single related
Mandelbrot-type set (magnet1m, magnet2m) and an infinite number of
related Julia-type sets (magnet1j, magnet2j), with the usual toggle
between the corresponding Ms and Js via the spacebar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you fancy delving into the Julia-types by hand, you will be prompted
for the real and imaginary parts of the parameter denoted by C.  The
result is symmetrical about the real axis (and therefore the initial
image gets drawn in half the usual time) if you specify a value of zero
for the imaginary part of C.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id historical note:  Another complication (besides the formulae) in
implementing these fractal types was that they all have a finite
attractor (1.0 + 0.0i), as well as the usual one at infinity.  This fact
spurred the development of finite attractor logic in Id.  Without this
code you can still generate these fractals, but you usually end up with
a pretty boring image that is mostly deep blue "lake", courtesy of Id&#8217;s
standard <a href="#_periodicity_logic">Periodicity Logic</a>.  See <a href="#_finite_attractors">Finite Attractors</a> for more information

<p>This type is the "Mandelbrot equivalent" of the <a href="#_lambda_sets">lambda</a> set.  A comment
is in order here.  Almost all the Id "Mandelbrot" sets are created from
orbits generated using formulas like \$z_(n+1) = f(z_n,c)\$, with
\$z_0\$ and \$c\$ initialized to the complex value corresponding
to the current pixel.  Our reasoning was that "Mandelbrots" are maps of
the corresponding "Julias".  Using this scheme each pixel of a
"Mandelbrot" is colored the same as the Julia set corresponding to that
pixel.  However, Kevin Allen informs us that the mandellambda set
appears in the literature with \$z_0\$ initialized to a critical
point (a point where the derivative of the formula is zero), which in
this case happens to be the point (.5,0).  Since Kevin knows more about
Dr. Mandelbrot than we do, and Dr. Mandelbrot knows more about fractals
than we do, we defer!  Id calculates mandelambda Dr. Mandelbrot&#8217;s way
instead of our way.  But all the other "Mandelbrot" sets in Id are still
calculated our way!  (Fortunately for us, for the classic Mandelbrot Set
these two methods are the same!)</p>

<p>Well now, folks, apart from questions of faithfulness to fractals named

works very well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;unless you are unlucky enough to pick a value that is
on a line between two actual roots.  In that case, the sequence explodes
into chaos, with results that diverge more and more wildly as you

<p>This fractal type shows the results for the polynomial \$Z^n - 1\$,

parameter, the "order" of the equation (an integer from 3 through 10&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;3 for \$x^3-1\$, 7 for \$x^7-1\$, etc.).  A second parameter is a

<p>The generating formula here is identical to that for <a href="#_newton_domains_of_attraction">newtbasin</a>, but the

root that would be "converged on" if you started using Newton&#8217;s formula
from that point, but according to the iteration when the value is close
to a root.  For example, if the calculations for a particular pixel
converge to the 7th root on the 23rd iteration, newtbasin will color
that pixel using color #7, but newton will color it using color #23.</p>

<p>These fractal types are contributions of Mark Peterson.  MarksMandel and
MarksJulia are two families of fractal types that are linked in the same
manner as the classic Mandelbrot/Julia sets: each MarksMandel set can be
considered as a mapping into the MarksJulia sets, and is linked with the
spacebar toggle.  The basic equation for these sets is:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\$z_(n+1) = lambda^("exp"-1) z_(n)^2 + lambda\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where \$z_0\$ = 0.0 and \$lambda\$ is \$(x+iy)\$ for
MarksMandel.  For MarksJulia, \$z_0 = (x + iy)\$ and \$lambda\$ is
a constant (taken from the MarksMandel spacebar toggle, if that method
is used).  The exponent is a positive integer or a complex number.  We
call these "families" because each value of the exponent yields a
different MarksMandel set, which turns out to be a kinda-polygon with
(exponent) sides.  The exponent value is the third parameter, after the
"initialization warping" values.  Typically one would use null warping
values, and specify the exponent with something like "params=0/0/5",
which creates an unwarped, pentagonal MarksMandel set.</p>

<p>Plasma clouds are real live fractals, even though we didn&#8217;t know it at

colors of the corner of a rectangle, and then continues recursively
quartering previous rectangles.  Random colors are averaged with those
of the outer rectangles so that small neighborhoods do not show much
change, for a smoothed-out, cloud-like effect.  The more colors your
video mode supports, the better.  The result, believe it or not, is a
fractal landscape viewed as a contour map, with colors indicating
constant elevation.  To see this, save and view with the <kbd>3</kbd> command
(see <a href="#_3d_images">"3D" Images</a>) and your "cloud" will be converted to a mountain!</p>

<p>This type accepts four parameters.</p>

value is 2.</p>

<p>The second determines whether to use the original algorithm (0) or a
modified one (1).  The new one gives the same type of images but draws
the dots in a different order.  It will let you see what the final image

plasma cloud (0) or to use the previous seed (1).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fourth parameter turns on 16-bit .POT output which provides much
smoother height gradations.  This is especially useful for creating
mountain landscapes when using the plasma output with a ray tracer such
as POV-Ray.</p>

<p>With parameter three set to 1, the next plasma cloud generated will be

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one complication.  Complex numbers have 2 parts, so they can be

Julia set.</p>

<p>One method of displaying the 4-dimensional object is to take a 3-

sophisticated!  See the Julibrot type!)</p>

<p>Two of Id&#8217;s faithful users went bonkers when we introduced the "formula"
type, and came up with all kinds of variations on escape-time fractals
using trig functions.  We decided to put them in as regular types, but
there were just too many!  So we defined the types with variable
functions and let you, the overwhelmed user, specify what the functions
should be!  Thus Scott Taylor&#8217;s "\$z = sin(z) + z^2\$" formula type
is now the "fn+fn" regular type, and EITHER function can be one of sin,
cos, tan, cotan, sinh, cosh, tanh, cotanh, exp, log, sqr, recip, ident,
zero, one, conj, flip, cosxx, asin, asinh, acos, acosh, atan, atanh,
sqrt, abs, or cabs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plus we give you 4 parameters to set, the complex coefficients of the
two functions!  Thus the innocent-looking "fn+fn" type is really 729
different types in disguise, not counting the damage done by the
parameters!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lee informs us that you should not judge fractals by their "outer"
appearance.  For example, the images produced by \$z = sin(z) + z^2\$
and \$z = sin(z) - z^2\$ look very similar, but are different when
you zoom in.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the book "The Beauty of Fractals", these images are offered as an
example of "how an apparently innocent system of differential equations
gives rise to unimaginably rich and complex behavior after
discretization."  The Volterra-Lotka equations are a refinement of
attempts to model predator-prey systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If x represents the prey population and y represents the predator
population, their relationship can be expressed as:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to Peitgen and Richter, "Hence, x grows at a constant rate in
the absence of y, and y decays at a constant rate in the absence of x.
The prey is consumed in proportion to y, and the predators expand in
proportion to x."  They proceed to "discretize" this system, by "mating"
the Euler and Heun methods.  For purposes of image computation, their
formula (equation 8.3 on page 125) can be interpreted as:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\${:
(x_"new" = x + h/2 [f(x,y) + f(x + pf(x,y), y + pg(x,y))]),

:}\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This formula can be used to plot or connect single points, starting with
arbitrary values of x(0) and y(0), to produce typical "strange
attractor" images such as the ones commonly derived from the Henon or
Lorenz formulae.  But to produce an escape-time fractal, we iterate this
formula for all (x, y) pairs that we can associate with pixels on our
monitor screen.  The standard window is: 0.0 &lt; x &lt; 6.0;  0.0 &lt; y &lt; 4.5.
Since the "unimaginably rich and complex behavior" occurs with the
points that do not escape, the inside coloring method assumes
considerable importance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parameters h and p can be selected between 0.0 and 1.0, and this
determines the types of attractors that will result.  Infinity and (1,
1) are predictable attractors.  For certain combinations, an "invariant
circle" (which is not strictly circular) and/or an orbit of period 9
also are attractive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The invariant circle and periodic orbit change with each (h, p) pair,
and they must be determined empirically.  That process would be
thoroughly impractical to implement through any kind of fixed formula.
This is especially true because even when these attractors are chosen,
the threshold for determining when a point is "close enough" is quite
arbitrary, and yet it affects the image considerably.  The best
compromise in the context of a generalized formula is to use either the
"zmag" or "bof60" inside coloring options.  See
<a href="#_insidebof60bof61zmagfmodperiodatan">Inside=bof60|bof61|zmag|fmod|period|atan</a> for details.  This formula
performs best with a relatively high bailout value; the default is set
at 256, rather than the standard default of 4.</p>

<p>The "passes option" (<kbd>X</kbd> options screen or "passes=" parameter) selects
one of the single-pass, dual-pass, triple-pass, solid-guessing
(default), solid-guessing after pass n, boundary tracing, tesseral,
synchronous orbits, or orbits modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option applies to most fractal types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Single-pass mode ("1") draws the screen pixel by pixel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dual-pass ("2") generates a half-resolution screen first as a preview
using 2x2-pixel boxes, and then generates the rest of the dots with a
second pass.  Dual-pass uses no more time than single-pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Triple-pass ("3") generates the coarse first pass of the solidguessing
mode (see "g" below), then switches to either "1" (with low resolution
video modes) or "2" (with higher resolution video modes).  The advantage
of '3' vs '2' is that when using high resolution modes, the first pass
has a much lower resolution (about 160x120) and is therefore much
quicker than the first pass of the passes=2 mode.  However, with the '2'
mode, the first pass does not represent wasted time.  The '3' mode
wastes the effort of generating the coarse first screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The single, dual, and triple pass modes all result in identical images.
These modes are for those who desire the highest possible accuracy.
Most people will want to use the guessing mode, described next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solid-guessing ("g") is the default.  It performs from two to four
visible passes - more in higher resolution video modes.  Its first
visible pass is actually two passes - one pixel per 4x4, 8x8, or 16x16
pixel box is generated, and the guessing logic is applied to fill in the
blocks at the next level (2x2, 4x4, or 8x8).  Subsequent passes fill in
the display at the next finer resolution, skipping blocks which are
surrounded by the same color.  Solid-guessing can guess wrong, but it
sure guesses quickly!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solid-guessing stop after pass n ("g1" through "g6") are a variation on
the guessing mode in which the algorithm stops after the nth pass.  This
facility is for exploring in low resolution when you&#8217;d rather see a low
resolution image with large blocky pixels filling the whole screen than
a small low resolution image such as you get with the <kbd>V</kbd> (View Windows)
command.  Note that on the <kbd>X</kbd> screen you can&#8217;t directly type g1 or g2.
Press g repeatedly until you get the option you want, or else use the
left or right arrow keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Boundary Tracing ("b"), which only works accurately with fractal types
(such as the Mandelbrot set, but not the Newton type) that do not
contain "islands" of colors, finds a color boundary, traces it around
the screen, and then "blits" in the color over the enclosed area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tesseral ("t") is a sort of "super-solid-guessing" option that
successively divides the image into subsections and colors in rectangles
that have a boundary of a solid color.  It&#8217;s actually slower than the
solid-guessing algorithm, but it looks neat, so we left it in.  This
mode is also subject to errors when islands of color appear inside the
rectangles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Diffusion Scan ("d") is a drawing type based on dithering techniques.
It scans the image spreading the points evenly and to each point it
paints a square of the appropriate size so that the image will be
incrementally enhanced.  This method calculates all the points in the
image being a good substitute for single/double/triple pass and presents
a quick visualization even in the slowest fractals.  With "fillcolor=0"
(below) the squares are not painted and the points are spread over the
image until all have being calculated (sort of a "fade in").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perturbation ("p") is a drawing type that is particularly fast when used
with deep-zooms of the Mandelbrot set that require arbitrary precision
arithmetic.  This initial implementation of perturbation does not
support periodicity checking and only supports a limited number of
inside and outside coloring algorithms.  Suspend and resume is not
supported with perturbation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "fillcolor=" option in the <kbd>X</kbd> screen or on the command line sets a
fixed color to be used by the boundary tracing and tesseral calculations
for filling in defined regions.  The effect of this is to show off the
boundaries of the areas delimited by these two methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Orbits ("o") draws an image by plotting the orbits of the escape time
fractals.  This technique uses the same coordinates to draw an image as
the other passes options, sets "passes=1" and no symmetry, and then
plots the orbits for each pixel.  Zooming into a "passes=o" image is in
fact zooming into the "passes=1" image, and the resulting image may not
be what is expected.  To find interesting places to investigate, press
<kbd>O</kbd> after an image has completed and watch the behaviour of the orbits
as the cursor is moved around the screen.  See <a href="#_orbits_window">Orbits Window</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "outside=summ" option causes orbits to increment a pixel&#8217;s color
number every time an orbit touchs it; the resulting display is a 2-d
histogram.  If "outside=" is some other value, then the "inside=" color
determines the color of the plotted orbits.  If "inside=0", then the
color number is incremented at the start of each pixel of the passes=1
image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "orbitdelay=" option controls how many orbits are computed before
the orbits are displayed on the screen.  This allows the orbits to
settle down.  The "orbitinterval=" option causes Orbits to plot every
nth orbit point.  A non-zero value of the "periodicity=" option causes
orbits to not plot orbits that have reached the bailout conditions or
where an orbit goes off the visible area of the image.  A zero value of
periodicity will plot all orbits except as modified by orbitdelay and
orbitinterval.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Synchronous orbits ("s") is an experimental mode using the "fractal
witchcraft" algorithm based on the Almondbread implementation by Michael
Ganss.  This algorithm optimizes deep zooms by calculating parallel
orbits starting at different points, and subdividing when the orbits
break formation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Synchronous orbits (also known as SOI) has some limitations.  SOI is
loosely coupled with Id and most options don&#8217;t work with it.  Only types
mandel and julia are implemented.  SOI is only useful for very deep
zooms, but only up to the limit of double precision.  Within this narrow
magnification range, SOI can result in tremndous speedups.  If you
invoke Id with "debug=3444" on the command line, a long double (rather
than double) version will be used, which allows zooming about 1000 times
deeper.  SOI really needs to be ported to Id&#8217;s arbitary precision.</p>

<h3 id="_distance_estimator_method">Distance Estimator Method</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is Phil Wilson&#8217;s implementation of an alternate method for the M
and J sets, based on work by mathematician John Milnor and described in
"The Science of Fractal Images", p. 198.  While it can take full
advantage of your color palette, one of the best uses is in preparing
monochrome images for a printer.  Using the 1600x1200x2 disk video mode
and an HP LaserJet, we have produced pictures of quality equivalent to
the black and white illustrations of the M-set in "The Beauty of
Fractals."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The distance estimator method widens very thin "strands" which are part
of the "inside" of the set.  Instead of hiding invisibly between pixels,
these strands are made one pixel wide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though this option is available with any escape time fractal type, the
formula used is specific to the mandel and julia types - for most other
types it doesn&#8217;t do a great job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To turn on the distance estimator method with any escape time  fractal
type, set the "Distance Estimator" value on the <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen (or
use the "distest=" command line parameter).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting the distance estimator option to a negative value -nnn enables
edge-tracing mode.  The edge of the set is displayed as color number
nnn.  This option works best when the "inside" and "outside" color
values are also set to some other value(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a 2 color (monochrome) mode, setting to any positive value results in
the inside of the set being expanded to include edge points, and the
outside points being displayed in the other color.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In color modes, setting to value 1 causes the edge points to be
displayed using the inside color and the outside points to be displayed
in their usual colors.  Setting to a value greater than one causes the
outside points to be displayed as contours, colored according to their
distance from the inside of the set.  Use a higher value for narrower
color bands, a lower value for wider ones.  1000 is a good value to
start with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second distance estimator parameter ("width factor") sets the
distance from the inside of the set which is to be considered as part of
the inside.  This value is expressed as a percentage of a pixel width,
the default is 71.  Negative values are now allowed and give a fraction
of a percent of the pixel width.  For example: -71 gives 1/71 % of the
pixel width.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should use 1 or 2 pass mode with the distance estimator method, to
avoid missing some of the thin strands made visible by it.  For the
highest quality, "maxiter" should also be set to a high value, say 1000
or so.  You&#8217;ll probably also want "inside" set to zero, to get a black
interior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enabling the distance estimator method automatically toggles to floating
point mode.  When you reset distest back to zero, remember to also turn
off floating point mode if you want it off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, images using the distance estimator method can take a
long time to calculate even on a fast machine, especially if a high
"maxiter" value is used.  One way of dealing with this is to leave it
turned off while you find and frame an image.  Then hit <kbd>B</kbd> to save the
current image information in a parameter file (see
<a href="#_parameter_saverestore_commands">Parameter Save/Restore Commands</a>).  Use an editor to change the parameter file
entry, adding "distest=1", "video=something" to select a high-resolution
monochrome disk-video mode, "maxiter=1000", and "inside=0".  Run the
parameter file entry with the <kbd>@</kbd> command when you won&#8217;t be needing your
machine for a while (over the weekend?).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To obtain the finest strands it is necessary to set the "width factor"
to a large negative value, such as -32000.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_inversion">Inversion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many years ago there was a brief craze for "anamorphic art": images
painted and viewed with the use of a cylindrical mirror, so that  they
looked weirdly distorted on the canvas but correct in the distorted
reflection. (This byway of art history may be a useful defense when your
friends and family give you odd looks for staring at fractal images
color-cycling on a CRT.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The inversion option performs a related transformation on most of the
fractal types.  You define the center point and radius of a circle; Id
maps each point inside the circle to a corresponding point outside, and
vice-versa.  This is known to mathematicians as inverting (or if you
want to get precise, "everting") the plane, and is something they can
contemplate without getting a headache.  John Milnor (also mentioned in
connection with the <a href="#_distance_estimator_method">Distance Estimator Method</a>), made his name in the
1950s with a method for everting a seven-dimensional sphere, so we have
a lot of catching up to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if a point inside the circle is 1/3 of the way from the
center to the radius, it is mapped to a point along the same radial
line, but at a distance of (3 * radius) from the origin.  An outside
point at 4 times the radius is mapped inside at 1/4 the radius.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The inversion parameters on the <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen allow entry of the
radius and center coordinates of the inversion circle.  A default choice
of -1 sets the radius at 1/6 the smaller dimension of the image
currently on the screen.  The default values for Xcenter and Ycenter use
the coordinates currently mapped to the center of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try this one out with a <a href="#_newton">Newton</a> plot, so its radial "spokes" will give
you something to hang on to.  Plot a Newton-method image, then set the
inversion radius to 1, with default center coordinates.  The center
"explodes" to the periphery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inverting through a circle not centered on the origin produces bizarre
effects that we&#8217;re not even going to try to describe.  Aren&#8217;t computers
wonderful?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_decomposition">Decomposition</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll remember that most fractal types are calculated by iterating a
simple function of a complex number, producing another complex number,
until either the number exceeds some pre-defined "bailout" value, or the
iteration limit is reached.  The pixel corresponding to the starting
point is then colored based on the result of that calculation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decomposition option ("decomp=", on the <kbd>X</kbd> screen) toggles to
another coloring protocol.  Here the points are colored according to
which quadrant of the complex plane (negative real/positive imaginary,
positive real/positive imaginary, etc.) the final value is in.  If you
use 4 as the parameter, points ending up in each quadrant are given
their own color; if 2 (binary decomposition), points in alternating
quadrants are given 2 alternating colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result is a kind of warped checkerboard coloring, even in areas that
would ordinarily be part of a single contour.  Remember, for the M-set
all points whose final values exceed 2 (by any amount) after, say, 80
iterations are normally the same color; under decomposition, Id runs 80
iterations and then colors according to where the actual final value
falls on the complex plane.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using decomposition, a higher bailout value will give a more
accurate plot, at some expense in speed.  You might want to set the
bailout value (in the parameters prompt following selection of a new
fractal type; present for most but not all types) to a higher value than
the default.  A value of about 50 is a good compromise for M/J sets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_logarithmic_palettes_and_color_ranges">Logarithmic Palettes and Color Ranges</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, Id maps iterations to colors 1:1.  For example, if the
calculation for a fractal "escapes" (exceeds the bailout value) after N
iterations, the pixel is colored as color number N.  If N is greater
than the number of colors available, it wraps around.  So, if you are
using a 16-color video mode, and you are using the default maximum
iteration count of 150, your image will run through the 16-color palette
150/16 = 9.375 times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you use Logarithmic palettes, the entire range of iteration values
is compressed to map to one span of the color range.  This results in
spectacularly different images if you are using a high iteration limit
and are zooming in on an area near a "lakelet".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using a compressed palette in a 256 color mode, we suggest changing
your colors from the usual defaults.  The last few colors in the default
color map are black.  This results in points nearest the "lake" smearing
into a single dark band, with little contrast from the blue (by default)
lake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id has a number of types of compressed palettes, selected by the "Log
Palette" line on the <kbd>X</kbd> screen, or by the "logmap=" command line
parameter:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>logmap=1: for standard logarithmic palette.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>logmap=N (&gt;1): Same as logmap=1, but starting from iteration count N.
Pixels with iteration counts less than N are mapped to color 1.  This
is useful when zooming in an area near the lake where no points in the
image have low iteration counts - it makes use of the low colors which
would otherwise be unused.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>logmap=-N (&lt; -1): Similar to logmap=N, but uses a square root
distribution of the colors instead of a logarithmic one.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>logmap=2 or -2: Auto calculates the logmap value for maximum effect.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>logmap=-1: "old" logarithmic palette.  It differs from logmap=1 in
that some colors are not used - logmap=1 "spreads" low color numbers
which are unused by logmap=-1's pure logarithmic mapping so that all
colors are assigned.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to change the 1:1 mapping of iteration counts to colors is
to use the "ranges=" parameter.  It has the format:
   ranges=aa/bb/cc/dd/&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Iteration counts up to and including the first value are mapped to color
number 0, up to and including the second value to color number 1, and so
on.  The values must be in ascending order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A negative value can be specified for "striping".  The negative value
specifies a stripe width, the value following it specifies the limit of
the striped range.  Two alternating colors are used within the striped
range.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:   ranges=0/10/30/-5/65/79/32000
This example maps iteration counts to colors as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    color    iterations
    -------------------
      0      unused (formula always iterates at least once)

      2      11 to 30
      3      31 to 35, 41 to 45, 51 to 55, and 61 to 65

<h3 id="_biomorphs">Biomorphs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Related to <a href="#_decomposition">Decomposition</a> are the "biomorphs" invented by Clifford
Pickover, and discussed by A. K. Dewdney in the July 1989 "Scientific
American", page 110.  These are so-named because this coloring scheme
makes many fractals look like one-celled animals.  The idea is simple.
The escape-time algorithm terminates an iterating formula when the size
of the orbit value exceeds a predetermined bailout value.  Normally the
pixel corresponding to that orbit is colored according to the iteration
when bailout happened.  To create biomorphs, this is modified so that if
EITHER the real OR the imaginary component is LESS than the bailout,
then the pixel is set to the "biomorph" color.  The effect is a bit
better with higher bailout values: the bailout is automatically set to
100 when this option is in effect.  You can try other values with the
"bailout=" option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biomorph option is turned on via the "biomorph=nnn" command-line
option (where "nnn" is the color to use on the affected pixels).  When
toggling to Julia sets, the default corners are three times bigger than
normal to allow seeing the biomorph appendages.  Does not work with all
types - in particular it fails with any of the mandelsine family.
However, it works great in two-color modes.  Try it with the marksmandel
and marksjulia types.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_continuous_potential">Continuous Potential</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: This option can only be used with 256 color video modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id&#8217;s images are usually calculated by the "level set" method, producing
bands of color corresponding to regions where the calculation gives the
same value.  When "3D" transformed (see <a href="#_3d_images">"3D" Images</a>), most images other
than plasma clouds are like terraced landscapes: most of the surface is
either horizontal or vertical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the best results with the "illuminated" 3D fill options 5 and 6,
there is an alternative approach that yields continuous changes in
colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuous potential is approximated by calculating</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\$"potential" = log("modulus")/2^"iterations"\$
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where "modulus" is the orbit value (magnitude of the complex number)
when the modulus bailout was exceeded, at the "iterations" iteration.
Clear as mud, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, you don&#8217;t have to understand all the details.  However,
there are a few points to understand.  First, Id&#8217;s criterion for halting
a fractal calculation, the "modulus bailout value", is generally set to
4.  Continuous potential is inaccurate at such a low value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parameters for continuous potential are:
    potential=maxcolor[/slope[/modulus[/16bit]]]
These parameters are present on the <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Maxcolor" is the color corresponding to zero potential, which plots as
the top of the mountain.  Generally this should be set to one less than
the number of colors, i.e. usually 255.  Remember that the last few
colors of the default palette are black, so you won&#8217;t see what you are
really getting unless you change to a different palette.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Slope" affects how rapidly the colors change&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the slope of the
"mountains" created in 3D.  If this is too low, the palette will not
cover all the potential values and large areas will be black.  If it is
too high, the range of colors in the picture will be much less than
those available.  There is no easy way to predict in advance what this
value should be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Modulus" is the bailout value used to determine when an orbit has
"escaped".  Larger values give more accurate and smoother potential.  A
value of 500 gives excellent results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"16bit":  If you transform a continuous potential image to 3D, the
illumination modes 5 and 6 will work fine, but the colors will look a
bit granular.  This is because even with 256 colors, the continuous
potential is being truncated to integers.  The "16bit" option can be
used to add an extra 8 bits of goodness to each stored pixel, for a much
smoother result when transforming to 3D.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id&#8217;s visible behavior is unchanged when 16bit is enabled, except that
solid guessing and boundary tracing are not used.  But when you save an
image generated with 16bit continuous potential:
 * The saved file is a fair bit larger.
 * Id names the file with a .pot extension instead of .gif, if you
   didn&#8217;t specify an extension in "savename".
 * The image can be used as input to a subsequent <kbd>3</kbd> command to get the
   promised smoother effect.
 * If you happen to view the saved image with a GIF viewer other than
   Id, you&#8217;ll find that it is twice as wide as it is supposed to be.
   (Guess where the extra goodness was stored!) Though these files are
   structurally legal GIF files the double-width business made us think
   they should perhaps not be called GIF - hence the .pot filename
   extension.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 16bit (.pot) file can be converted to an ordinary 8 bit GIF by
<kbd>R</kbd>estoring it, changing "16bit" to "no" on the <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen, and
<kbd>S</kbd>aving.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might find with 16bit continuous potential that there&#8217;s a long delay
at the start of an image, and disk activity during calculation.  Id uses
its disk-video cache area to store the extra 8 bits per pixel - if there
isn&#8217;t sufficient memory available, the cache will page to disk.</p>

<h3 id="_starfields">Starfields</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have generated your favorite fractal image, you can convert it
into a fractal starfield with the <kbd>A</kbd> transformation (for 'astronomy'? -
once again, all of the good letters were gone already).  Stars are
generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis - the odds that a particular pixel
will coalesce into a star are based (partially) on the color index of
that pixel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(The following was supplied by Mark Peterson, the starfield author.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the screen were entirely black and the "Star Density per Pixel" were
set to 30 then a starfield transformation would create an evenly
distributed starfield with an average of one star for every 30 pixels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re on a 320x200 screen then you have 64000 pixels and would end
up with about 2100 stars.  By introducing the variable of "Clumpiness"
we can create more stars in areas that have higher color values.  At
100% clumpiness a color value of 255 will change the average of finding
a star at that location to 50:50.  A lower clumpiness values will lower
the amount of probability weighting.  To create a spiral galaxy draw
your favorite spiral fractal (IFS, Julia, or Mandelbrot) and perform a
starfield transformation.  For general starfields I&#8217;d recommend
transforming a plasma fractal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Real starfields have many more dim stars than bright ones because very
few stars are close enough to appear bright.  To achieve this effect the
program will create a bell curve based on the value of ratio of dim
stars to bright stars.  After calculating the bell curve the curve is
folded in half and the peak used to represent the number of dim stars.</p>

<h3 id="_parameter_explorerevolver">Parameter Explorer/Evolver</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Id is such a wonderfully complex program it has more than a few
parameters to tweak and options to select.  To the inexperienced user
the choice is bewildering.  Even for the experts the chaotic nature of
the mathematical processes involved make it difficult to know what to
change in order to achieve the desired effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to help with this situation the Id parameter evolver has been
developed.  It varies those parameters for you and puts the results on
screen as a grid of small images.  You can then choose the one which you
like best and regenerate it full screen, or if you don&#8217;t like any of the
variations, you can try again to see if anything better turns up!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enough explanations for now, lets see how easy it is to use:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the default Mandlebrot set on the screen simply hold down the
<span class="keyseq"><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd></span> key on the top row (DON&#8217;T use the numeric keypad to the right,
it won&#8217;t work).  You&#8217;ll see a screen full of images generated starting
from the middle and spiraling outwards.  The perfect Mandlebrot set will
be in the middle and the others will be warped and distorted by having
had the initial value of Z perturbed at random&#8230;&#8203; but you don&#8217;t need to
know that (which is the whole point really!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd></span> produces a low level of mutation of the fractal, only 'mild'
parameters are changed, those which have a more subtle effect.  For much
wilder variations try pressing <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd></span> now.  This give the maximum
available mutation with just about everything being twiddled and fiddled
to rather dramatic effect as you should now be seeing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To select an image for full screen display simply bring up a zoombox by
pressing 'Page-up' once.  The center image will now have a white box
around it.  Hold down the <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd></span> keys to move this box around
until it&#8217;s outlining an image you like.  Pressing <kbd>B</kbd> will now exit from
evolver mode and redraw the selected image full size.  If, rather than
exiting from evolver mode, you just press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, then a whole new set
of images is generated, all based around the one you selected (which is
now the middle image of the new set).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From a basic point of view that&#8217;s it!  Just press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd></span> &#8230;&#8203; <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd></span> to
scramble things when you&#8217;re out of inspiration, it works for any of the
fractal types in Id including formulae&#8230;&#8203; easy! (chaotic, but easy :-) )</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As this is an Id feature, there is, of course, a lot more to it than the
basics described above&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a start, there are some handy hotkeys to use, <kbd>F2</kbd> and <kbd>F3</kbd> are used
to alter the amount of mutation or the amount by which the selected
parameters can be varied. <kbd>F2</kbd> halves the amount of mutation, <kbd>F3</kbd>
doubles it.  So if things on-screen are looking a bit samey just press
<kbd>F3</kbd> a few times to crank up the mutation level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using <kbd>F2</kbd> to decrease mutation levels is a way of moving towards a goal
image.  Say that a set of images contained one that looked a little
like, maybe, a cats face and you wished to try and get something more
cat like.  To achieve this simply select the desired image and press
<kbd>F2</kbd>.  The newly generated images should be more alike, though probably
still quite widely varied.  With luck, one of the new images will be
even more cat like.  Select this one and press <kbd>F2</kbd> again.  Continue
like this, selecting the center image again if there are no improvements
in the current generation, until eventually all the images are alike and
you&#8217;ve arrived at your goal (or at least you&#8217;re probably as close as
it&#8217;s possible to get with that fractal type).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you look for more details in the images it is useful to reduce the
number of images per generation, thus producing larger sub images.
Pressing <kbd>F4</kbd> will reduce the number of images per side on the grid by
two and pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> increments the gridsize similarly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><kbd>F6</kbd> will switch between normal random mutation and 'spread' random
mutation.  In 'spread' mode the amount of mutation allowed in an image
is varied according to each images position in the grid.  Those images
near the center are allowed a lesser degree of freedom of mutation than
those around the outside.  This produces a sea of images, stable at the
center with wilder variations around the edges.  This mode is best used
with larger gridsizes and becomes completely silly at a gridsize of
three!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> brings up the evolver control screen on which you have manual
access to the evolution parameters varied by the hotkeys described
above.
These are:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Gridsize.            The number of sub images per side of the

                     odd numbers only.</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock">

between
                     generations.  This can be used to automatically goal

                     area for display use.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pressing <kbd>F6</kbd> brings up a screen from which you can control what
parameters get varied and in what manner.  You&#8217;ll notice that as well as
the mutation modes 'random' and 'spread' there are other ways of
stirring things around, read on&#8230;&#8203;&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As well as randomly mutating parameter values (referred to as 'evolver
mode' or just 'evolving') a chosen set of parameters can be varied
steadily across the screen thus allowing the user to explore what
happens as a parameter is slowly changed ('explorer mode' or
'exploring').  For example, to get acquainted with parameter exploring
and produce a map of the Julia sets, try this:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start Id and set the type to Julia and the resolution higher than
320x200, once the default Julia set has been generated, press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span>
to bring up the evolver/explorer control panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set evolve mode to yes and then press <kbd>F6</kbd> to bring up the screen that
allows you to choose what gets varied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now set the first entry (param1) to 'x' and the second (param2) to
'y'.  This tells Id to vary param1 (the real part of c) across the
screen and param2 (the imaginary part of c) down the screen.  Make
sure all the other parameters are set to 'no' so that nothing else
gets changed to confuse things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press &lt;Return&gt; to go back to the main evolver control screen and
you&#8217;ll see that a few more items have appeared.  These control just
how much the parameters are varied across the screen and what their
starting values should be, leave them as they are but increase gridsz
to 15.  Also switch on the parameter zoom box option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you exit this control screen with the &lt;Return&gt; key, you&#8217;ll see a
grid of Julia sets generated all mapped out onto the imaginary plane,
squint and you&#8217;ll be able to spot the underlying Mset!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you press <kbd>PageUp</kbd> this time you&#8217;ll notice that there are two
boxes on screen with a larger box centered around the normal selection
box.  <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PageUp</kbd></span> or <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PageDown</kbd></span> varies the size of this box
which represents the 'parameter' zoom box.  The parameter zoombox
allows you to look at smaller areas of the parameter space in more
detail.  To explain this further look at how the Julia sets change
across the screen, around the area of 'seahorse valley' on the
underlying Mset, the Julia sets undergo a sharp change in character.
This area of change can be examined in more detail using parameter
zooming.  Make the outer zoombox a few grids across and select an
image in the area of this change with the outer box straddling it.
Look at the images right in the corners of the parm zoombox, when you
press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and a new generation of images is generated the same
images will be in the corners of the screen with more sub images
between them, allowing a finer look at how the change progresses.  In
this way, you can observe the chaotic areas in parameter space with
the unique pseudo four dimensional view offered by the explorer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the example shown above, you were just exploring the variation in two
'real' parameters, i.e. they can take fractional values, and the idea of
being able to create an image half way between two others is valid.
However, many of the parameters in Id are discrete, i.e. can be only one
of a set of specific values.  Examples of discrete parameters are inside
colouring method or decomposition values and the way in which these are
explored is different in that parameter zooming has no meaning for
discrete parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a discrete parameter is set to vary with x or y it is simply cycled
through all possible values and round again.  Words are getting clumsy
so it&#8217;s time for another example methinks!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First press 'Insert' to restart Id and get everything back to its
default values for a fresh start.  Set the fractal type to 'fn*fn' this
type requires the user to choose two trig functions and this choice is
made on the 'Z' screen.  There are around thirty different functions to
choose from and checking out all the different combinations is a not
inconsiderable task manually.  With the explorer, however, it&#8217;s a piece
of cake!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Set the screen resolution to the highest you can view and press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span>
to bring up the control panel and enable evolving mode.  Set the
gridsize to 29 and leave the parameters at their defaults.  Now, press
<kbd>F6</kbd> to enter 'variable tweak central' and set trig function 1 to 'x'
and trig function 2 to 'y', and all the others to 'no'.  Exit the two
screens and you&#8217;ll see generated all of the different combinations
possible even if they are rather small examples!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To find out what particular combination of trig functions an image is
using, just select the image using the zoombox and bring up the 'z'
screen.  You don&#8217;t have to press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, simply highlighting the
appropriate image with the Ctrl+arrow keys will do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that just about sums up the evolver!  Much more could be written but
it&#8217;s better experienced, try writing your formulae with more variable
parameters and trig functions so that their behavior can be
investigated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try using it with any fractal type, if in doubt just see what happens!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be noted here that some of the fractal types such as the IFS
do not terminate, they run on forever and as such aren&#8217;t usable with the
evolver as the first sub image would never finish to allow the next one
to generate.  These fractal types are detected and you won&#8217;t be allowed
to start the evolver with these.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There now only remains to mention that you can save image sets and
restore them later to carry on exploring from a different seed image:
<kbd>S</kbd> saves and <kbd>R</kbd> restores as in normal Id operation and the screenfull
is saved as a single GIF file.</p>

<h3 id="_random_dot_stereograms_rds">Random Dot Stereograms (RDS)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Random dot stereograms (RDS) are a way of encoding stereo images on a
flat screen.  Id can convert any image to a RDS using either the color
number in the current palette or the grayscale value as depth.  Try
these steps.  Generate a plasma fractal using the 256 color video mode.
When the image on the screen is complete, press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span> ("S" for
"Stereo"), and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> at the "RDS Parameters" screen prompt to
accept the defaults. (More on the parameters in a moment.) The screen
will be converted into a seemingly random collection of colored dots.
Relax your eyes, looking through the screen rather than at the screen
surface.  The image will (hopefully) resolve itself into the hills and
valleys of the 3D Plasma fractal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because pressing the two-keyed <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span> gets tiresome after a while, we
have made <kbd>K</kbd> key a synonym for <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span> for convenience.  Don&#8217;t get too
attached to <kbd>K</kbd> though; we reserve the right to reuse it for another
purpose later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RDS feature has five and sometimes six parameters.  Pressing
<span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span> always takes you to the parameter screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first parameter allows you to control the depth effect.  A larger
value (positive or negative) exaggerates the sense of depth.  If you
make the depth negative, the high and low areas of the image are
reversed.  If your RDS image is streaky try either a lower depth factor
or a higher resolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second parameter indicates the overall width in inches of the image
on your monitor.  The default value is 10 inches.  If you&#8217;re having
trouble seeing the image, enter the image width in inches.  The issue
here is that if the widest separation of left and right pixels is
greater than the physical separation of your eyes, you will not be able
to fuse the images.  Conversely, a too-small separation may cause your
eyes to hyper-converge (fuse the wrong pixels together).  A larger width
value reduces the width between left and right pixels.  You can use the
calibration feature to help set the width parameter - see below.  Once
you have found a good width setting, you can place the value in your
sstools.ini file with the command stereowidth=&lt;nnn&gt;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third parameter allows you to control the method use to extract
depth information from the original image.  If your answer "no" at the
"Use Grayscale value for Depth" prompt, then the color number of each
pixel will be used.  This value is independent of active color palette.
If you answer "yes" and the prompt, then the depth values are keyed to
the brightness of the color, which will change if you change palettes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fourth parameter allows you to set the position of vertical stereo
calibration bars to the middle or the top of the image, or have the bars
initially turned off.  Use this feature to help you adjust your eye&#8217;s
convergence to see the image.  You will see two vertical bars on the
screen.  You can turn off and on these bars with the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>
keys after generating the RDS image.  If you save an RDS image by
pressing <kbd>S</kbd>, if the bars are turned on at the time, they become a
permanent part of the image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you relax your eyes and look past the screen, these bars will appear
as four bars.  When you adjust your eyes so that the two middle bars
merge into one bar, the 3D image should appear.  The bars are set for
the average depth in the area near the bars.  They should always be
closer together than the physical separation of your eyes, but not much
less than about 1.5 inches.  About 1.75 inches is ideal for many images.
The depth and screen width controls affect the width of the bars.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the RDS Parameters screen, you can select bars at the middle of the
screen or the top.  If you select "none", the bars will initially be
off, but immediately after generation of the image you can still turn on
the bars with <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> before you press any other keys.  If
the initial setting of the calibration bars is "none", then if the bars
are turned on later they will appear in the middle.  Hint: if you cycle
the colors and find you can&#8217;t see the calibration bar, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or
<kbd>Space</kbd> twice, and the bars will turn to a more visible color.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fifth parameter asks if you want to use an image map GIF file
instead of using random dots.  An image map can give your RDS image a
more interesting background texture than the random dots.  If you answer
"yes" at the "Use image map?" prompt, Id will present you with a file
selection list of GIF images.  Id will then go ahead and transform your
original image to RDS using the selected image map to provide the
"random" dots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you have selected an image map file, the next time you reach the
RDS Parameters screen you will see an additional prompt asking if you
want to use the same image map file again.  Answering "yes" avoids the
file selection menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best images to use as image maps are detailed textures with no solid
spots.  The default type=circle fractal works well, as do the barnsley
fractals if you zoom in a little way.  If the image map is smaller than
your RDS image, the image map will repeated to fill the space.  If the
image map is larger, just the upper left corner of the image map will be
used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original image you are using for your stereogram is saved, so if you
want to modify the stereogram parameters and try again, just press
<span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span> (or <kbd>K</kbd>) to get the parameter screen, changes the parameters,
and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  The original image is restored and an RDS transform
with the revised parameters is performed.  If you press <kbd>S</kbd> when viewing
an RDS image, after the RDS image is saved, the original is restored.</p>

<h3 id="_freestyle_mode_tutorial">Freestyle mode tutorial</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be confusing working out what&#8217;s going on in freestyle mode so
here&#8217;s a quick walk through&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Freestyle palette editing is intended to be a way of colouring an image
in an intuitive fashion with the minimum of keyboard usage.  In fact
everything is controllable with the mouse, as the following shows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start with, generate a plasma type fractal as it has all 256 colours
on screen at once.  Now bring up the palette editor and press <kbd>W</kbd> to set
up a greyscale palette as a blank canvas on which to splash some colour.
Pressing <kbd>F</kbd> puts us in freestyle mode&#8230;&#8203; crosshairs appear on the
screen and a colour band is applied, centred on the cursor.  Although,
at the moment, the colour of this band is grey and you won&#8217;t see much!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to change the colour of the band, hold down the primary mouse
button and drag up and down.  This changes the amount of red in the
band.  You&#8217;ll see the values change in the status box above the palette
grid.  Double clicking the secondary mouse button changes the colour
component that&#8217;s varied in an r-g-b-r-cycle&#8230;&#8203;. try it out and conjure
up any shade you like!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To vary the width of the band, drag up and down with the secondary
button held down.  Slower machines may show some 'lag' during this
operation, so watch out as the mouse movements get buffered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got the band in a satisfactory position then double click
the primary button to fix it in place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continue like this for as long as you like, adding different colours to
the grey palette.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll notice how the band relates to the existing colour, the RGB
values give the middle colour which are then smoothly shaded out to the
colours at the ends of the band.  This can lead to some sudden jumps in
the shading as the band is moved about the screen and the edges come to
overlap different areas of colour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For really violent jumps in shading try starting with an image that has
areas that change chaotically, such as a Mandlbrot set.  You&#8217;ll see what
I mean when you move the cross hairs into an area close to the 'lake'
where the change in value from one pixel to the next is sudden, chaotic
and large.  Watch out!&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the strobing effect can be somewhat
disturbing.  This is nothing to worry about but just a consequence of
the manipulation of the palette and the way in which the colour bands
are calculated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope that you&#8217;ll find this a useful tool in colouring an image.
Remember that the <kbd>H</kbd> key can be used to hide the palette box and expose
the whole image.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id can restore images in "3D".  Important: we use quotation marks
because it does not create images of 3D fractal objects (there are such,
but we&#8217;re not there yet.) Instead, it restores .GIF images as a 3D
projection or stereo image pair.  The iteration values you&#8217;ve come to
know and love, the ones that determine pixel colors, are translated into
"height" so that your saved screen becomes a landscape viewed in
perspective.  You can even wrap the landscape onto a sphere for
realistic-looking planets and moons that never existed outside your PC!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We suggest starting with a saved plasma-cloud screen.  Hit <kbd>3</kbd> in main
command mode to begin the process.  Next, select the file to be
transformed, and the video mode. (Usually you want the same video mode
the file was generated in; other choices may or may not work.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After hitting <kbd>3</kbd>, you&#8217;ll be bombarded with a long series of options.
Not to worry: all of them have defaults chosen to yield an acceptable
starting image, so the first time out just pump your way through with
the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.  When you enter a different value for any option, that
becomes the default value the next time you hit <kbd>3</kbd>, so you can change
one option at a time until you get what you want.  Generally <kbd>Esc</kbd> will
take you back to the previous screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;re familiar with the effects of the 3D option values you have a
variety of options on how to specify them.  You can specify them all on
the command line, with an sstools.ini file, or with a parameter file.</p>

when viewed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Option 1 gives 64 shades of gray but with half the spatial resolution
you have selected.  It works by writing the red and blue images on
adjacent pixels, which is why it eats half your resolution.  In
general, we recommend you use this only with higher resolution video
modes.  Use this mode for continuous potential landscapes where you
<strong>need</strong> all those shades.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Option 2 gives you full spatial resolution but with only 16 shades

<p>Id can create files of its 3D transformations which are compatible with
many ray tracing programs.  Currently four are supported directly:
DKB (now obsolete), VIVID, MTV, and RAYSHADE.  In addition a "raw"
output is supported which can be relatively easily transformed to be
usable by many other products.
One other option is supported: ACROSPIN.  This is not a ray tracer,
but the same Id options apply.</p>

<p>Users of POV-Ray can use the DKB output and convert to POV-Ray with the
DKB2POV utility that comes with POV-Ray.  A better (faster) approach is to
create a raw output file and convert to POV-Ray with RAW2POV.  A still
better approach is to use POV-Ray&#8217;s height field feature to directly
read the fractal .gif or .pot file and do the 3D transformation inside
POV-Ray.</p>

<p>All ray tracing files consist of triangles which follow the surface
created by Id during the 3D transform.  Triangles which lie below
the "water line" are not created in order to avoid causing unnecessary
work for the poor ray tracers which are already overworked.
A simple plane can be substituted by the user at the
waterline if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The size (and therefore the number) of triangles created is determined
by the "coarse" parameter setting.  While generating the ray tracing
file, you will view the image from above and watch it partitioned into
triangles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The color of each triangle is the average of the color of its verticies
in the original image, unless brief is selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If brief is selected, a default color is assigned at the begining of the
file and is used for all triangles.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_select_fill_type_screen">Select Fill Type Screen</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option exists because in the course of the 3D projection, portions
of the original image may be stretched to fit the new surface.  Points
of an image that formerly were right next to each other, now may have a
space between them.  This option generally determines what to do with
the space between the mapped dots.  It is not used if you have selected
a value for ray other than 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For an illustration, pick the second option "just draw the points",
which just maps points to corresponding points.  Generally this will
leave empty space between many of the points.  Therefore you can choose
various algorithms that "fill in" the space between the points in
various ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, try the first option "make a surface grid." This option will make
a grid of the surface which is as many divisions in the original "y"
direction as was set in "coarse" in the first screen.  It is very fast,
and can give you a good idea what the final relationship of parts of
your picture will look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, try the second option "connect the dots (wire frame)", then
"surface fills" - "colors interpolated" and "colors not interpolated",
the general favorites of the authors.  Solid fill, while it reveals the
pseudo-geology under your pseudo-landscape, inevitably takes longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, try the light source fill types.  These two algorithms allow you
to position the "sun" over your "landscape." Each pixel is colored
according to the angle the surface makes with an imaginary light source.
You will be asked to enter the three coordinates of the vector pointing
toward the light in a following parameter screen - see
<a href="#_light_source_parameters">Light Source Parameters</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Light source before transformation" uses the illumination direction
without transforming it.  The light source is fixed relative to your
computer screen.  If you generate a sequence of images with progressive
rotation, the effect is as if you and the light source are fixed and the
object is rotating.  Therefore, as the object rotates features of the
object move in and out of the light.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Light source after transformation" applies the same transformation to
both the light direction and the object.  Since both the light direction
and the object are transformed, if you generate a sequence of images
with the rotation progressively changed, the effect is as if the image
and the light source are fixed in relation to each other and you orbit
around the image.  The illumination of features on the object is
constant, but you see the object from different angles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For ease of discussion we will refer to the following fill types by
these numbers:
    1 - surface grid
    2 - (default) - no fill at all - just draw the dots
    3 - wire frame - joins points with lines
    4 - surface fill - (colors interpolated)
    5 - surface fill - (interpolation turned off)
    6 - solid fill - draws lines from the "ground" up to the point
    7 - surface fill with light model - calculated before 3D transforms
    8 - surface fill with light model - calculated after 3D transforms</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Types 4, 7, and 8 interpolate colors when filling, making a very smooth
fill if the palette is continuous.  This may not be desirable if the
palette is not continuous.  Type 5 is the same as type 4 with
interpolation turned off.  You might want to use fill type 5, for
example, to project a .gif photograph onto a sphere.  With type 4, you
might see the filled-in points, since chances are the palette is not
continuous; type 5 fills those same points in with the colors of
adjacent pixels.  However, for most fractal images, fill type 4 works
better.</p>

<h3 id="_stereo_3d_viewing">Stereo 3D Viewing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Funny Glasses Parameters" (stereo 3D) screen is presented only if
you select a non-zero stereo option in the prior 3D parameters.  (See
<a href="#_3d_mode_selection">3D Mode Selection</a>.)  We suggest you definitely use defaults at first on
this screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you look at an image with both eyes, each eye sees the image in
slightly different perspective because they see it from different
places.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first selection you must make is ocular separation, the distance the
between the viewers eyes.  This is measured as a % of screen and is an
important factor in setting the position of the final stereo image in
front of or behind the CRT Screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second selection is convergence, also as a % of screen.  This tends
to move the image forward and back to set where it floats.  More
positive values move the image towards the viewer.  The value of this
parameter needs to be set in conjunction with the setting of ocular
separation and the perspective distance.  It directly adjusts the
overall separation of the two stereo images.  Beginning anaglyphers love
to create images floating mystically in front of the screen, but
grizzled old 3D veterans look upon such antics with disdain, and believe
the image should be safely inside the monitor where it belongs!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Left and Right Red and Blue image crop (% of screen also) help keep the
visible part of the right image the same as the visible part of the left
by cropping them.  If there is too much in the field of either eye that
the other doesn&#8217;t see, the stereo effect can be ruined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Red and Blue brightness factor: the generally available red/blue-green
glasses, made for viewing on ink on paper and not the light from a CRT,
let in more red light in the blue-green lens than we would like.  This
leaves a ghost of the red image on the blue-green image (definitely not
desired in stereo images).  We have countered this by adjusting the
intensity of the red and blue values on the CRT.  In general you should
not have to adjust this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final entry is the map file name (present only if stereo=1 or
stereo=2 was selected).  If you have a special map file you want to use
for stereo 3D this is the place to enter its name.  Generally
glasses1.map is for type 1 (alternating pixels), and glasses2.map is for
type 2 (superimposed pixels).  Grid.map is great for wire-frame images
using 16 color modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This screen is not available if you have selected a ray tracing option.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rectangular_coordinate_transformation">Rectangular Coordinate Transformation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first entries are rotation values around the X, Y, and Z axes.
Think of your starting image as a flat map: the X value tilts the bottom
of your monitor towards you by X degrees, the Y value pulls the left
side of the monitor towards you, and the Z value spins it counter-
clockwise.  Note that these are NOT independent rotations: the image is
rotated first along the X-axis, then along the Y-axis, and finally along
the Z-axis.  Those are your axes, not those of your (by now hopelessly
skewed) monitor.  All rotations actually occur through the center of the
original image.  Rotation parameters are not used when a ray tracing
option has been selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then there are three scaling factors in percent.  Initially, leave the X
and Y axes alone and play with Z, now the vertical axis, which
translates into surface "roughness."  High values of Z make spiky, on-
beyond-Alpine mountains and improbably deep valleys; low values make
gentle, rolling terrain.  Negative roughness is legal: if you&#8217;re doing
an M-set image and want Mandelbrot Lake to be below the ground, instead
of eerily floating above, try a roughness of about -30%.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next we need a water level&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;really a minimum-color value that performs
the function "if (color &lt; waterlevel) color = waterlevel".  So it plots
all colors "below" the one you choose at the level of that color, with
the effect of filling in "valleys" and converting them to "lakes."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we enter a perspective distance, which you can think of as the
"distance" from your eye to the image.  A zero value (the default) means
no perspective calculations, which allows use of a faster algorithm.
Perspective distance is not available if you have selected a ray tracing
option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For non-zero values, picture a box with the original X-Y plane of your
flat fractal on the bottom, and your 3D fractal inside.  A perspective
value of 100% places your eye right at the edge of the box and yields
fairly severe distortion, like a close view through a wide-angle lens.
200% puts your eye as far from the front of the box as the back is
behind.  300% puts your eye twice as far from the front of the box as
the back is, etc.  Try about 150% for reasonable results.  Much larger
values put you far away for even less distortion, while values smaller
than 100% put you "inside" the box.  Try larger values first, and work
your way in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you are prompted for two types of X and Y shifts (now back in the
plane of your screen) that let you move the final image around if you&#8217;d
like to re-center it.  The first set, x and y shift with perspective,
move the image and the effect changes the perspective you see.  The
second set, "x and y adjust without perspective", move the image but do
not change perspective.  They are used just for positioning the final
image on the screen.  Shifting of any type is not available if you have
selected a ray tracing option.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_3d_color_parameters">3D Color Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are asked for a range of "transparent" colors, if any.  This option
is most useful when using the <a href="#_3d_overlay_mode">3D Overlay Mode</a>.  Enter the color range
(minimum and maximum value) for which you do not want to overwrite
whatever may already be on the screen.  The default is no transparency
(overwrite everything).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, for the final option.  This one will smooth the transition between
colors by randomizing them and reduce the banding that occurs with some
maps.  Select the value of randomize to between 0 (for no effect) and 7
(to randomize your colors almost beyond use). 3 is a good starting
point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s all for this screen.  Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for these parameters and the
next and final screen will appear (honestly!).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_light_source_parameters">Light Source Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This one deals with all the aspects of light source and Targa files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must choose the direction of the light from the light source.  This
will be scaled in the x, y, and z directions the same as the image.  For
example, 1,1,3 positions the light to come from the lower right front of
the screen in relation to the untransformed image.  It is important to
remember that these coordinates are scaled the same as your image.
Thus, "1,1,1" positions the light to come from a direction of equal
distances to the right, below and in front of each pixel on the original
image.  However, if the x,y,z scale is set to 90,90,30 the result will
be from equal distances to the right and below each pixel but from only
1/3 the distance in front of the screen i.e.. it will be low in the sky,
say, afternoon or morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then you are asked for a smoothing factor.  Unless you used
<a href="#_continuous_potential">Continuous Potential</a> when generating the starting image, the illumination when
using light source fills may appear "sparkly", like a sandy beach in
bright sun.  A smoothing factor of 2 or 3 will allow you to see the
large-scale shapes better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smoothing is primarily useful when doing light source fill types with
plasma clouds.  If your fractal is not a plasma cloud and has features
with sharply defined boundaries (e.g. Mandelbrot Lake), smoothing may
cause the colors to run.  This is a feature, not a bug. (A copyrighted
response of [your favorite commercial software company here], used by
permission.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ambient option sets the minimum light value a surface has if it has
no direct lighting at all.  All light values are scaled from this value
to white.  This effectively adjusts the depth of the shadows and sets
the overall contrast of the image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you selected the full color option, you have a few more choices.  The
next is the haze factor.  Set this to make distant objects more hazy.
Close up objects will have little effect, distant objects will have
most.  0 disables the function. 100 is the maximum effect, the farthest
objects will be lost in the mist.  Currently, this does not really use
distance from the viewer, we cheat and use the y value of the original
image.  So the effect really only works if the y-rotation (set earlier)
is between +/- 30.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you can choose the name under which to save your Targa file.  If
you have not set "overwrite=yes" then the file name will be incremented
to avoid over-writing previous files.  If you are going to overlay an
existing Targa file, enter its name here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you may select the background color for the Targa file.  The
default background on the Targa file is sky blue.  Enter the Red, Green,
and Blue component for the background color you wish.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, absolutely the last option (this time we mean it): you can now
choose to overlay an existing Targa-24, type 2, non mapped, top-to-
bottom file, such as created by Id or PVRay.  The Targa file specified
above will be overlayed with new info just as a GIF is overlayed on
screen.  Note: it is not necessary to use the <kbd>O</kbd> overlay command to
overlay Targa files.  The targa_overlay parameter must be set to yes,
however.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll probably want to adjust the final colors for monochrome fill
types using light source via <a href="#_color_cycling_commands">color cycling</a>.  Try one of the more
continuous palettes (<kbd>F8</kbd> through <kbd>F10</kbd>), or load the gray palette with
the <kbd>A</kbd>lternate-map command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, lie down for a while in a quiet room with a damp washcloth on your
forehead.  Feeling better?  Good&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because it&#8217;s time to go back almost
to the top of the 3D options and just say yes to:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Picture a globe lying on its side, "north" pole to the right.  (It&#8217;s our
planet, and we&#8217;ll position it the way we like.)  You will be mapping the
X and Y axes of the starting image to latitude and longitude on the
globe, so that what was a horizontal row of pixels follows a line of
longitude.  The defaults exactly cover the hemisphere facing you, from
longitude 180 degrees (top) to 0 degrees (bottom) and latitude -90
(left) to latitude 90 (right).  By changing them you can map the image
to a piece of the hemisphere or wrap it clear around the globe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next entry is for a radius factor that controls the over-all size of
the globe.  All the rest of the entries are the same as in the landscape

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that not all that many years ago, one of us watched
Benoit Mandelbrot and fractal-graphics wizard Dick Voss creating just
such a moon-over-landscape image at IBM&#8217;s research center in Yorktown
Heights, NY.  The system was a large and impressive mainframe with
floating-point facilities, running LBLGRAPH&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;what Mandelbrot calls "an
independent-minded and often very ill-mannered heap of graphics programs
that originated in work by Alex Hurwitz and Jack Wright of IBM Los
Angeles."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;d like to salute LBLGRAPH, its successors, and their creators,
because it was their graphic output (like "Planetrise over Labelgraph
Hill", plate C9 in Mandelbrot&#8217;s "Fractal Geometry of Nature") that
helped turn fractal geometry from a mathematical curiosity into a
phenomenon.  We&#8217;d also like to point out that it wasn&#8217;t as fast,
flexible or pretty as Id.  Now, a lot of the difference has to do with
the incredible progress of micro-processor power since then, so a lot of
the credit should go to Intel rather than to our highly tuned code.  OK,
twist our arms&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it is awfully good code.</p>

<h3 id="_making_terrains">Making Terrains</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you enjoy using Id for making landscapes, we have several features
for you to work with.  When doing 3D transformations, banding tends to
occur because all pixels of a given height end up the same color.  Now,
colors can be randomized to make the transitions between different
colors at different altitudes smoother.  Use the "randomize=n" parameter
to accomplish this.  If your light source images all look like lunar
landscapes since they are all monochrome and have very dark shadows, we
now allow you to set the ambient light for adjusting the contrast of the
final image.  Use the "ambient=n" parameter.  In addition to being able
to create scenes with light sources in monochrome, you can now do it in
full color as well.  Setting the parameter "fullcolor=1" will generate a
Targa-24 file with a full color image which will be a combination of the
original colors of the source image (or map file if you select
map=something) and the amount of light which reflects off a given point
on the surface.  Since there can be 256 different colors in the original
image and 256 levels of light, you can now generate an image with lots
of colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the full color option allows you to also set a haze factor with
the "haze=n" parameter to make more distant objects more hazy.</p>

<p>Bruce Goren, a stereoscopic maven, contributed these tips on what to do
with your 3D images.  (Bruce inspired and prodded us so much we
automated much of what follows, allowing both this and actual on screen
stereo viewing, but we included it here for reference and a brief
tutorial.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I move the viewport or imaginary camera left and right to create two
separate views of the stationary object in x,y,z, space.  The distance
between the two views, known as the inter-ocular distance, toe-in or
convergence angle, is critical.  It makes the difference between good 3-
D and headache-generating bad 3-D.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"For a 3D fractal landscape, I created and photographed the left and
right eye views as if flying by in an imaginary airplane and mounted the
film chips for stereo viewing.  To make my image, first I generated a
plasma cloud based on a color map I calculated to resemble a geological
survey map.  In the 3D reconstruction, I used a perspective value of 150
and shifted the camera -15 and +15 on the X-axis for the left and right
views.  All other values were left to the defaults.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The images are captured on a Matrix 3000 film recorder&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;basically a
box with a high-resolution black and white TV and a 35mm film camera
(Konica FS-1) looking at the TV screen through a filter wheel.  I glass
mount the film chips myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Each frame is exposed three times, once through each of the red, blue,
and green filters to create a color image from computer video without
the scan-lines which normally result from photographing television
screens.  The aspect ratio of the resulting images led me to mount the
chips using the 7-sprocket Busch-European Emde masks."</p>

<h3 id="_interfacing_with_ray_tracing_programs">Interfacing with Ray Tracing Programs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Also see "Ray Tracing Output", "Brief", and "Output File Name" in
<a href="#_3d_mode_selection">3D Mode Selection</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id allows you to save your 3D transforms in files which may be fed to a
ray tracer (or to "Acrospin").  However, they are not ready to be traced
by themselves.  For one thing, no light source is included.  They are
actually meant to be included within other ray tracing files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the intent is to produce an object which may be included in a
larger ray tracing scene, it is expected that all rotations, shifts, and
final scaling will be done by the ray tracer.  Thus, in creating the
images, no facilities for rotations or shifting is provided.  Scaling is
provided to achieve the correct aspect ratio.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WARNING!  The files created using the ray tracing options can be large.
Setting coarse to 40 will result in over 2000 triangles.  Each triangle
can utilize from 50 to 200 bytes each to describe, so your ray tracing
files can rapidly approach or exceed 1 MB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each file starts with a comment identifying the version of Id by which
it was created.  The file ends with a comment giving the number of
triangles in the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The files consist of long strips of adjacent triangles.  Triangles
vertices are listed in clockwise or counter clockwise order depending on
the target ray tracer.  Currently, MTV and Rayshade are the only ones
which use counter clockwise order.  The size of the triangles is set by
the coarse setting in the main 3D menu.  Color information about each
individual triangle is included for all files unless in the brief mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To keep the poor ray tracer from working too hard, if waterline is set
to a non zero value, no triangle which lies entirely at or below the
current setting of waterline is written to the ray tracing file.  These
may be replaced by a simple plane in the syntax of the ray tracer you
are using.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id&#8217;s coordinate system has the origin of the x-y plane at the upper left
hand corner of the screen, with positive x to the right and positive y
down.  The ray tracing files have the origin of the x-y plane moved to
the center of the screen with positive x to the right and positive y up.
Increasing values of the color index are out of the screen and in the +z
direction.  The color index 0 will be found in the xy plane at z=-1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When x, y and z scale are set to 100, the surface created by the
triangles will fall within a box of +/- 1.0 in all 3 directions.
Changing scale will change the size and/or aspect ratio of the enclosed
object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will only describe the structure of the raw format here.  If you want
to understand any of the ray tracing file formats besides raw, please
see your favorite ray tracer docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The raw format simply consists of a series of clockwise triangles.  If
brief=yes, Each line is a vertex with coordinates x, y, and z.  Each
triangle is separated by a couple of CR&#8217;s from the next.  If brief=no,
the first line in each triangle description if the r,g,b value of the
triangle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting brief=yes produces shorter files with the color of each triangle
removed - all triangles will be the same color.  These files are
otherwise identical to normal files but will run faster than the non
brief files.  Also, with brief=yes, you may be able to get files with
more triangles to run than with brief=no.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DKB format is now obsolete.  POV-Ray users should use the raw output
and convert to POV-Ray using the POV Group&#8217;s RAW2POV utility.  POV-Ray
users can also do all 3D transformations within POV-Ray using height
fields.</p>

<h3 id="_introduction_to_parameters">Introduction to Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id accepts command-line parameters that allow you to start it with a
particular video mode, fractal type, starting coordinates, and just
about every other parameter and option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These parameters can also be specified in a sstools.ini file, to set
them every time you run Id.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They can also be specified as named groups in a .par (parameter) file
which you can then call up while running Id by using the <kbd>@</kbd> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all three cases (command line, sstools.ini, and parameter file) the
parameters use the same syntax, usually a series of keyword=value
commands like sound=off.  Each parameter is described in detail in
subsequent sections.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_the_command_line">Using the Command Line</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can specify parameters when you start Id by using a command like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>id sound=off filename=myimage.gif</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The individual parameters are separated by one or more spaces (an
parameter itself may not include spaces).  Upper or lower case may be
used, and parameters can be in any order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id has a special command you can use when you have a lot of startup
parameters (or have a set of parameters you use frequently):</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>id @myfile</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When @filename is specified on the command line, Id reads parameters
from the specified file as if they were keyed on the command line.  You
can create the file with a text editor, putting one "keyword=value"
parameter on each line.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_setting_defaults_sstools_ini_file">Setting Defaults (sstools.ini File)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every time Id runs, it searches the current directory, and then the
directories in your PATH, for a file named sstools.ini.  If it finds
this file, it begins by reading parameters from it.  This file is useful
for setting parameters you always want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The file sstools.ini is divided into sections belonging to particular
programs.  Each section begins with a label in brackets.  Id looks for
the label [id], and ignores any lines it finds in the file belonging to
any other label.  If an sstools.ini file looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[id]
sound=off      ; (for home use only)
inside=0       ; using "traditional" black

warp=9.5       ; Captain, I dinna think the engines can take it!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id will use only the second and third lines of the file.  (Why use a
convention like that when Id is the only program you know of that uses
an sstools.ini file?  Because there are other programs (such as Lee
Crocker&#8217;s PICLAB) that now use the same file, and there may one day be
other, sister programs to Id using that file.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_parameter_files_and_the_command">Parameter Files and the <kbd>@</kbd> Command</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can change parameters on-the-fly while running Id by using the <kbd>@</kbd>
or <kbd>2</kbd> command and a parameter file.  Parameter files contain named
groups of parameters, looking something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>quickdraw {      ; a set of parameters named quickdraw
   maxiter=150
   float=no
}
slowdraw {       ; another set of parameters
   maxiter=2000
   float=yes
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use the <kbd>@</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> command and select a parameter file containing
the above example, Id will show two choices: quickdraw and slowdraw.
You move the cursor to highlight one of the choices and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to
set the parameters specified in the file by that choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default parameter file name is id.par.  A different file can be
selected with the "parmfile=" option, or by using <kbd>@</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> and then
hitting <kbd>F6</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can create parameter files with a text editor, or for some uses, by
using the <kbd>B</kbd> command.  Parameter files can be used in a number of ways,
some examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To save the parameters for a favorite image.  Id can do this for you
with the <kbd>B</kbd> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To save favorite sets of 3D transformation parameters.  Id can do
this for you with the <kbd>B</kbd> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To set up different sets of parameters you use occasionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To save image parameters for later use in batch mode - see
<a href="#_batch_mode">Batch Mode</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Formulas, ifs, and lsystem entries referred to in a parameter entry can
be included in a .par file by adding the prefix frm:, ifs:, or lsys:
respectively, for example frm:myformula {rest of that formula}.  Note
that the prefix is a label, not part of the formula name, so the
reference in the image entry would be formulaname=myformula.  The
formula, ifs, and lsystem entries added to a parfile are accessed only
when the image entry in the parfile is run.  To make these formulas
generally accessible, they must be added to a .frm, .ifs or .l file
(without the identifying prefix, of course).</p>

<h3 id="_startup_parameters">Startup Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>@FILENAME
Causes Id to read "filename" for parameters.  When it finishes, it
resumes reading its own command line&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;i.e., "id maxiter=250 @myfile
passes=1" is legal.  This option is only valid on the command line, as
Id is not clever enough to deal with multiple indirection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>@FILENAME/groupname
Like @FILENAME, but reads a named group of parameters from a parameter
file.  See <a href="#_parameter_files_and_the_command">Parameter Files and the <kbd>@</kbd> Command</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TEMPDIR=[directory]
This command allows to specify the directory where Id writes temporary
files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WORKDIR=[directory]
This command sets the directory where miscellaneous Id files get
written, including makemig.bat and debugging files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FILENAME=[name]
Causes Id to read the named file, which must either have been saved from
an earlier Id session or be a generic GIF file, and use that as the
starting point, bypassing the initial information screens.  The filetype
is optional and defaults to .gif.  Non-Id GIF files are restored as
fractal type "plasma".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the command line you may omit filename= and just give the file name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CURDIR=yes
Id uses directories set by various commands, possibly in the sstools.ini
file.  If you want to try out some files in the current directory, such
as a modified copy of id.frm, you won&#8217;t Id to read the copy in your
official FRM directory.  Setting curdir=yes at the command line will
cause Id to look in the current directory for requested files first
before looking in the default directory set by the other commands.
Warning: <kbd>Tab</kbd> screen may not reflect actual file opened in cases where
the file was opened in the current directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MAKEPAR=parfile/entryname
This command invokes a batch facility to copy fractal and color
information stored in GIF files to par format.  The syntax is:
     id filename.gif makepar=parfile.par/entryname
The entryname is optional and defaults to the name of the GIF filename
if absent.  Other parameters can appear before the makepar= command, but
anything after will ignored.  If the parfile and entryname exist, the
entry will replace the previous entry.  If the entry doesn&#8217;t exist, it
will be added.  If the parfile doesn&#8217;t exist it will be created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you leave the GIF filename out of the command lime but add a map=
command, then the makepar command will write a par named for the color
map with only the colors in the par entry.  This is a handy tool for
converting maps into compressed par colors entry.  For example, you
could type:
     id map=lyapunov.map makepar=mycolors
This adds a colors-only par entry called lyapunov.map to mycolors.par.</p>
</div>

<p>MAXLINELENGTH=nnn
This command sets the maximum width of lines in a par entry.</p>
</div>

<p>COMMENT=[comment1]/[comment2]/[comment3]/[comment4]
Inserts comments into par files.  These comments can include variables
that are expanded at the time the par file is created.  Variables are
indicated by $varname$.  Underscore characters are expanded to blanks.
If you want to include the special characters '$', '_', or '\' in a
comment, precede the character with '\'.  Supported variables are:</p>

This commands controls the logic that automatically selects one of
float/arbitrary precision based on precision requirements of the current
zoom depth.  The first number was used to control the integer/float
transition and is now ignored.  The second number controls the
float/arbitrary precision transition.  The default value of .05 means
that the ratio between the exact and calculated width and height is
between .95 and 1.05.  A larger value than .05 (say .10) makes the test
looser so that the lower precision math is used longer.  A value &#8656; 0

Begin with these coordinates as the range of x and y coordinates, rather
than the default values of (for type=mandel) -2.0/2.0/-1.5/1.5.  When
you specify four values (the usual case), this defines a rectangle: x
coordinates are mapped to the screen, left to right, from xmin to xmax,
y coordinates are mapped to the screen, bottom to top, from ymin to
ymax.  Six parameters can be used to describe any rotated or stretched
parallelogram:
  (xmin,ymax) are used for the top-left corner of the screen,</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  (xmax,ymin) are used for the bottom-right corner, and
  (x3rd,y3rd) are used for the bottom-left corner.
Entering just "corners=" tells Id to use this form rather than "center-
mag" (see below) when saving parameters with the kbd:[B] command.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CENTER-MAG=[Xctr/Yctr/Mag[/Xmagfactor/rotation/skew]]
This is an alternative way to enter corners as a center point and a
magnification that is popular with some fractal programs and
publications.  Entering just "center-mag=" tells Id to use this form
(the default mode) rather than "corners=" (see above) when saving
parameters with the <kbd>B</kbd> command.  The <kbd>Tab</kbd> status display shows the
"corners" in both forms.  When you specify three values (the usual
case), this defines a rectangle:  (Xctr, Yctr) specifies the coordinates
of the center of the image while Mag indicates the amount of
magnification to use.  Six parameters can be used to describe any
rotated or stretched parallelogram:  Xmagfactor tells how many times
bigger the x-magnification is than the y-magnification, rotation
indicates how many degrees the image has been turned, and skew tells how
many degrees the image is leaning over.  Positive angles will rotate and
skew the image counter-clockwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BAILOUT=nnn
Overrides the default bailout criterion for escape-time fractals.  Can
also be set from the parameters screen after selecting a fractal type.
See description of bailout in <a href="#_the_mandelbrot_set">The Mandelbrot Set</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BAILOUTEST=mod|real|imag|or|and|manh|manr
Specifies the <a href="#_bailout_test">Bailout Test</a> used to determine when the fractal
calculation has exceeded the bailout value.  The default is mod and not
all fractal types can utilize the additional tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RESET
Causes Id to reset all calculation related parameters to their default
values.  Non-calculation parameters such as "sound=", and "savename="
are not affected.  Reset should be specified at the start of each
parameter file entry (used with the <kbd>@</kbd> command) which defines an image,
so that the entry need not describe every possible parameter - when
invoked, all parameters not specifically set by the entry will have
predictable values (the defaults).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>INITORBIT=pixel
INITORBIT=nnn/nnn
Allows control over the value used to begin each Mandelbrot-type orbit.
"initorbit=pixel" is the default for most types; this command
initializes the orbit to the complex number corresponding to the screen
pixel.  The command "initorbit=nnn/nnn" uses the entered value as the
initializer.  See the discussion of the <a href="#_mandellambda_sets">Mandellambda Sets</a> for more on
this topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSEED=nnnn
The initial random-number "seed" for plasma clouds is taken from your
computer&#8217;s internal clock-timer.  This argument forces a value (which
you can see in the <kbd>Tab</kbd> display), and allows you to reproduce plasma
clouds.  A detailed discussion of why a truly random number may be
impossible to define, let alone generate, will have to wait for
"Iterated Dynamics: The 3-MB Doc File."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SHOWDOT=[auto|bright|medium|dark|&lt;nnn&gt;[/&lt;size&gt;]]
Colors the current dot being calculated color &lt;nnn&gt; or an automatically
calculated color taken from the current palette.  The second parameter
is the size of the traveling pointer in units of pixels of 1/1024th of a
screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The travelling pointer may strobe or flicker with fast fractals because
of interaction with the monitor&#8217;s vertical refresh.  The orbitdelay
parameter can be used to introduce a per-pixel delay when showdot is
turned on.  Try orbitdelay=1000 with "showdot=b/20" to get a feel for
how the showdot triangle works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ASPECTDRIFT=&lt;nn&gt;
When zooming in or out, the aspect ratio (the width to height ratio) can
change slightly due to rounding and the noncontinuous nature of pixels.
If the aspect changes by a factor less than &lt;nn&gt;, then the aspect is set
to it&#8217;s normal value, making the center-mag Xmagfactor parameter equal
to 1.  (see CENTER-MAG above.)  The default is 0.01.  A larger value
adjusts more often.  A value of 0 does no adjustment at all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_color_parameters">Color Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>INSIDE=nnn|maxiter|bof60|bof61|zmag|epscross|startrail|period|atan|fmod
Set the color of the interior: for example, "inside=0" makes the M-set
"lake" a stylish basic black with the default color map.  The option
"maxiter" makes the inside color the same as the value of maxiter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eight more options reveal hidden structure inside the lake.  The options
"bof60" and "bof61", are named after the figures on pages 60 and 61 of
"The Beauty of Fractals".  The option "zmag" is a method of coloring
based on the magnitude of Z after the maximum iterations have been
reached.  The affect along the edges of the Mandelbrot is like thin-
metal welded sculpture. The option "fmod" is a method of coloring based
on the magnitude of the last orbit within a set distance from the
origin.  The option "period" colors pixels according to the period of
their eventual orbit.  The option "atan" colors by determining the angle
in degrees the last iterated value has with respect to the real axis,
and using the absolute value. See
<a href="#_insidebof60bof61zmagfmodperiodatan">Inside=bof60|bof61|zmag|fmod|period|atan</a> for a brilliant explanation of
what these do!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option "epscross" colors pixels green or yellow according to whether
their orbits swing close to the Y-axis or X-axis, respectively.  The
option "startrail" has a coloring scheme based on clusters of points in
the orbits.  Best with outside=&lt;nnn&gt;.  For more information, see
<a href="#_insideepscrossstartrail">Inside=epscross|startrail</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the "Look for finite attractor" option on the <kbd>Y</kbd> options
screen will override the selected inside option if an attractor is found
- see <a href="#_finite_attractors">Finite Attractors</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OUTSIDE=nnn|iter|real|imag|summ|mult|atan|fmod|tdis
The classic method of coloring outside the fractal is to color according
to how many iterations were required before Z reached the bailout value,
usually 4.  This is the method used with the option "iter".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when Z reaches bailout the real and imaginary components can be
at very diferent values.  The options "real" and "imag" color using the
iteration value plus the real or imaginary values.  The option "summ"
uses the sum of all these values.  These options can give a startling 3D
quality to otherwise flat images and can change some boring images to
wonderful ones.  The option "mult" colors by multiplying the iteration
by real divided by imaginary.  There was no mathematical reason for
this, it just seemed like a good idea.  The option "atan" colors by
determining the angle in degrees the last iterated value has with
respect to the real axis, and using the absolute value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option "fmod" colors pixels according to the magnitude of the last
orbit point which is within a set distance from the origin.  Then:
  color = magnitude * colors / closeprox
The magnitude used for the comparison is now based on the same
calculation as is used for the bailout test.  The value of closeprox can
be varied interactively.  This feature was contributed by Iain Stirling.
There is a problem with the mandel fractal type when "outside=fmod" is
used with "inside=bof6x" and bailoutest set to "real", "imag", or
"manr".  This is likely due to changes made in the code so that bof
images could be reproduced.  Select a different fractal type that
produces the default mandel image to explore using these parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option "tdis" colors the pixels according to the total distance
traveled by the orbit.  This feature was suggested by Steve Robinson.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option "nnn" sets the color of the exterior to some number of your
choosing: for example, "outside=1" makes all points not inside the
fractal set to color 1 (blue in the default color map).  Note that
defining an outside color forces any image to be a two-color one: either
a point is inside the set, or it&#8217;s outside it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MAP=filename
Reads in a replacement color map from filename.  This map replaces the
default color map.  The difference between this argument and an
alternate map read in via <kbd>L</kbd> in color-command mode is that this one
applies to the entire run.  See <a href="#_color_maps">Color Maps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>COLORS=@filename|colorspecification
Sets colors for the current image, like the <kbd>L</kbd> function in color
cycling and palette editing modes.  Unlike the "map=" parameter, colors
set with "colors=" do not replace the default - when you next select a
new fractal type, colors will revert to their defaults.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option "@filename" tells Id to use a color map file named
"filename".  See <a href="#_color_maps">Color Maps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option "colorspecification" specifies the colors directly.  The
value of "colorspecification" is rather long (768 characters for 256
color modes), and its syntax is not documented here.  This form of the
"colors=" parameter is not intended for manual use - it exists for use
by the <kbd>B</kbd> command when saving the description of a nice image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RECORDCOLORS=auto|comment|yes
Controls the method of writing colors in par files.  The option "auto"
causes the colors to be written in the "colors=@mapfile" form if the
colors were loaded from a map.  Use this mode if you manage your colors
using map files.  If you share par files with others, and have trouble
remembering to send them the map file, use the option "comment" or
"yes".  These modes force the writing of compressed color maps in the
par file in all cases.  The only difference is that the comment option
also writes the map filename in a comment so you can remember where the
colors came from.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CYCLERANGE=nnn/nnn
Sets the range of color numbers to be animated during color cycling.
The default is 1/255, i.e. just color number 0 (usually black) is not
cycled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CYCLELIMIT=nnn
Sets the speed of color cycling.  Technically, the number of color
values updated during a single update.  Legal values are 1 - 256; the
default is 55.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TEXTCOLORS=mono
Set text screen colors to simple black and white.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TEXTCOLORS=aa/bb/cc/&#8230;&#8203;
Set text screen colors.  Omit any value to use the default (e.g.
textcolors=////50 to set just the 5th value).  Each value is a 2 digit
hexadecimal value; 1st digit is background color (from 0 to 7), 2nd
digit is foreground color (from 0 to F).
Color values are:
    0 black     8 gray
    1 blue      9 light blue
    2 green     A light green
    3 cyan      B light cyan

<p>OLDDEMMCOLORS=yes|no
Sets the old coloring scheme used with the distance estimator method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TRUECOLOR=yes
You can save either the default color scheme or the iteration escape
value to a file called fract001.tga.  The number is incremented each
time a file is saved unless the parameter overwrite is set to yes.  This
will allow experimentation with truecolor algorithms.  Someday we&#8217;ll

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NOBOF=yes|no
Setting this parameter to yes causes the bof60 and bof61 inside options
to function the same as the other inside options by making the per pixel

<h3 id="_doodad_parameters">Doodad Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LOGMAP=yes|old|n
Selects a compressed relationship between escape-time iterations and
palette colors.  See <a href="#_logarithmic_palettes_and_color_ranges">Logarithmic Palettes and Color Ranges</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LOGMODE=fly/table|auto
Forces the use of the on-the-fly routine or the logarithm table for the
calculation of log palettes.  Not normally needed.  The auto option
cannot be used at the same time as the other two.  Auto causes the
logmap value to be automatically recalculated when zooming.  Changing
almost anything will turn this feature off.  Set logmode=auto from the
<kbd>G</kbd> screen prompt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RANGES=nn/nn/nn/&#8230;&#8203;
Specifies ranges of escape-time iteration counts to be mapped to each
color number.  See <a href="#_logarithmic_palettes_and_color_ranges">Logarithmic Palettes and Color Ranges</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DISTEST=nnn/nnn
A nonzero value in the first parameter enables the distance estimator
method.  The second parameter specifies the "width factor" and defaults
to 71.  See <a href="#_distance_estimator_method">Distance Estimator Method</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DECOMP=2|4|8|16|32|64|128|256
Invokes the corresponding decomposition coloring scheme.  See
<a href="#_decomposition">Decomposition</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BIOMORPH=nnn
Turn on biomorph option; set affected pixels to color nnn.  See
<a href="#_biomorphs">Biomorphs</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>POTENTIAL=maxcolor[/slope[/modulus[/16bit]]]
Enables the continuous potential coloring mode for all fractal types
except plasma clouds, attractor types such as lorenz, and IFS.  The four
arguments define the maximum color value, the slope of the potential
curve, the modulus bailout value, and whether 16 bit values are to be
calculated.  Example: "potential=240/2000/40/16bit".  The Mandelbrot and
Julia types ignore the modulus bailout value and use their own hardwired
value of 4.0 instead.  See <a href="#_continuous_potential">Continuous Potential</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>INVERT=nn/nn/nn
Turns on inversion.  The parameters are radius of inversion, x-
coordinate of center, and y-coordinate of center. -1 as the first
parameter sets the radius to 1/6 the smaller screen dimension; no x/y
parameters defaults to center of screen.  The values are displayed with
the <kbd>Tab</kbd> command.  See <a href="#_inversion">Inversion</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FINATTRACT=no|yes
Another option to show coloring inside some Julia "lakes" to show escape
time to finite attractors.  Works with lambda, magnet types, and
possibly others.  See <a href="#_finite_attractors">Finite Attractors</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EXITNOASK=yes
This option forces Id to bypass the final "are you sure?" exit screen
when the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is pressed from the main image-generation screen.
Added at the request of Ward Christensen.  It&#8217;s his funeral &lt;grin&gt;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_file_parameters">File Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Id you can use various filename variables to specify files, set
default directories, or both.  For example, in the savename description
below, [name] can be a filename, a directory name, or a fully qualified
pathname plus filename.  You can specify default directories using these
variables in your sstools.ini file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SAVEDIR=&lt;path&gt;
Sets the directory used when writing output files.  The "savename"
parameter may use a relative path to the value of the "savedir"
parameter if savedir is specified first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SAVENAME=[&lt;path&gt;\][name]
Set the path and/or filename to use when you <kbd>S</kbd>ave a screen.  The
default filename is fract001.  The .gif extension is optional (Example:
"savename=myfile")</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OVERWRITE=no|yes
Sets the savename overwrite flag (default is no).  If yes, saved files
will over-write existing files from previous sessions; otherwise the
automatic incrementing of fract001.gif will find the first unused
filename.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SAVETIME=nnn
Tells Id to automatically do a save every nnn minutes while a
calculation is in progress.  This is mainly useful with long batches -
see <a href="#_batch_mode">Batch Mode</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DITHER=yes
Dither a color file into two colors for monochrome display.  This gives
a poor-quality display of gray levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PARMFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\][parmfilename]
Specifies the default parameter path and/or file to be used by the <kbd>@</kbd>
(or <kbd>2</kbd>) and <kbd>B</kbd> commands.  If not specified, the default is id.par.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FORMULAFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\][formulafilename]
Specifies the formula path and/or file for type=formula fractals
(default is id.frm).  Handy if you want to generate one of these fractal
types in batch mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\][lsystemfile]
Specifies the default L-system path and/or file for type=lsystem
fractals (default is id.l).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IFSFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\][ifsfilename]
Specifies the default path and/or file for type=ifs fractals (default is
id.ifs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FILENAME=[.suffix]
Sets the default file extension used for the <kbd>R</kbd> command.  When this
parameter is omitted, the default file mask shows .gif and .pot files.
You might want to specify this parameter and the SAVENAME= parameter in
your sstools.ini file if you keep your fractal images separate from
other .gif files by using a different suffix for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ORBITSAVE=yes
Causes the orbits file to be opened and the points generated by orbit
fractals or IFS fractals to be saved in a raw format.  The file will be
overwritten if "overwrite=yes".  Otherwise, each time a new fractal is
generated a new file is written with this option.
(see <a href="#_barnsley_ifs_fractals">Barnsley IFS Fractals</a> <a href="#_orbit_fractals">Orbit Fractals</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ORBITSAVENAME=[filename]
Sets the name of the orbit file to be written when "orbitsave=yes" is
used.  Defaults to orbits.raw.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_video_parameters">Video Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>VIDEO=xxx
Set the initial video mode (and bypass the informational screens).
Handy for batch runs. (Example: "video=f4") You can obtain the current
video values (key assignments) from the "Select Video Mode" screen
inside Id.  If you want to do a batch run with a video mode which isn&#8217;t
currently assigned to a key, you&#8217;ll have to modify the key assignments -
see <a href="#_video_mode_function_keys">Video Mode Function Keys</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ASKVIDEO=yes|no
If "no", this eliminates the prompt asking you if a file to be restored
is OK for your current video hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>VIEWWINDOWS=xx[/xx[/yes|no[/nn[/nn]]]]
Set the reduction factor, final media aspect ratio, crop starting
coordinates (y/n), explicit x size, and explicit y size, see <a href="#_view_window">View Window</a>
.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FASTRESTORE=yes|no
If "yes", resets viewwindow to "no" prior to restoring a GIF file.
Otherwise, images saved in full view will be drawn in reduced view if
viewwindows has been set to "yes" previously.  Also, when "yes",
bypasses the warning when restoring a GIF in a video mode other than the
one in which the GIF was saved.  Default is "no".  This feature is
useful when cycling through a group of GIFs in autokey mode.  When
combined with "askvideo=no", allows loading images with the last
successfully used video mode.  This is handy when viewing 1600x1200
images when you only have 1024x768 available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>VIRTUAL=yes|no
With a suitable video mode it is possible to set virtual screen modes
using the <a href="#_view_window">View Window</a> options.  With certain video modes it may be
necessary to disable the check for virtual screen modes if this check
prevents Id from loading correctly.  The default is "yes".  Setting this
to "no" disables the check for and the ability to use virtual screen
sizes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sound_parameters">Sound Parameters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SOUND=off|beep|x|y|z/pc|fm/quant
We&#8217;re all much too busy to waste time with Id at work, and no doubt you
are too, so "sound=off" is included only for use at home, to avoid
waking the kids or your significant other, late at night.  (By the way,
didn&#8217;t you tell yourself "just one more zoom on LambdaSine" an hour
ago?)  Suggestions for a "boss" hot-key will be cheerfully ignored, as
this sucker is getting big enough without including a spreadsheet screen
too.  The "sound=x|y|x" options are for the attractor fractals, like the
Lorenz fractals - they play with the sound as they are generating an
image, based on the X or Y or Z co-ordinate they are displaying at the
moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now hear the sound of fractal orbits&#8212;&#8203;just turn on sound from
the command line, the <kbd>X</kbd> menu, or the <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></span> menu, fire up a fractal,
and try the <kbd>O</kbd>rbits command (or set "showorbit=yes").  Use the
"orbitdelay=&lt;nnn&gt;" parameter (also on the <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></span> menu) to dramatically
alter the effect, which ranges from an unearthly scream to a series of
discrete tones.  Not recommended when people you have to live with are
nearby!  Remember, we don&#8217;t promise that it will sound beautiful!  There
is also an option to quantize the notes generated by Id.  See
<a href="#_sound_controls">Sound Controls</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also "hear" any image that Id can decode; turn on sound before
using <kbd>R</kbd> to read in a GIF file.  We have no idea if this feature is
useful.  It was inspired by the comments of an on-line friend who is
blind.  We solicit feedback and suggestions from anyone who finds these
sound features interesting or useful.  The orbitdelay parameter also
affects the sound of decoding images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HERTZ=&lt;nnn&gt;
Adjusts the sound produced by the "sound=x|y|z" option.  The actual
sounds produced are limited to the range of 20-5000 Hz.  Setting a
negative Hertz value allows shifting the range of sounds produced down
into the bass range.  This also eliminates some of the notes since
anything under 20 Hz or over 5000 Hz will not be played.</p>

<p>ORBITDELAY=&lt;nn&gt;
Slows up the display of orbits using the <kbd>O</kbd> command for folks with hot
new computers.  Units are in 1/10000 seconds per orbit point.
ORBITDELAY=10 therefore allows you to see each pixel&#8217;s orbit point for
about one millisecond.  For best display of orbits, try "passes=1" and a
moderate resolution such as 900x600.  Note that the first time you press
the <kbd>O</kbd> key with the orbitdelay function active, your computer will
pause for a half-second or so to calibrate a high-resolution timer.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>SHOWORBIT=yes|no

<p>Id produces sounds using FM synthesis as made popular by the OPL-3
chipset on early PC sound cards.  The OPL-3 chipset has within it
several voices, each capable of generating sound independently of the
others, and with a variety of controllable parameters.  See

quantisation.  When this is enabled, tones that are to be played are
first rounded to the nearest note on the western even tempered scale

spectrum of frequencies.  The <a href="#_advanced_sound_controls">Advanced Sound Controls</a> screen also has a

<p>The sound output from Id is a tad versatile.  This comes into its own
when playing sounds based on fractal orbits, producing results from
haunting chordal pulses through to unearthly arpeggios.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The voices used to generate notes on the sound card have variable
<a href="#_envelopes">Envelopes</a> and can be played polyphonically so we have three parameters
to vary the sounds produced:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>POLYPHONY=nn
This controls how many different note are allowed to sound at once,
voices are assigned cyclically as notes are played: i.e. after the first
orbit is calculated a frequency is assigned to the first voice and that
note is triggered on.  Id then waits for one orbitdelay period,
calculates the next orbit, assigns a frequency to the second voice, and
triggers it on.  This continues until the number of voices sounding is
equal to the polyphony value whereupon the first selected voice is
triggered off and the note allowed to decay.  That probably all sounds
horrendously complex but just think of it as playing the organ, holding
down each new note for as long as possible but with the polyphony value
controlling how many fingers you have.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>ATTACK=nn
This controls the time taken for a note to hit full volume after being
triggered on.  Low values give a punchy percussive sound while long
values give a softer bowed sound.  If attack time is set too long and
orbitdelay is low then notes are played too fast to ever achieve any
volume and the net result is low or non existent output.  To put it
another way, if orbitdelay is low then this value should be low also.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DECAY=nn
This controls the time taken for a note to die down to the sustain
level.  Setting this time too low may produce a rhythmic click between
notes.  The attack and decay values don&#8217;t allow much fine control.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SUSTAIN=nn
This controls the volume level at which a note is held.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SRELEASE=nn
This controls the delay in time for releasing a note.  A release value
of 15 seems to equate to 'never let the note release' on the machine
used to develop the sound card drivers.  But, as ever, with other
manufacturer&#8217;s emulations your mileage may vary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>VOLUME=nn
It is possible to adjust the volume of an FM synth card.  This has no
effect on the PC speaker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ATTENUATE=none|low|mid|high
On an FM synth card it is possible to attenuate the high pitched notes.
The default is none.  The low value attenuates at 1.5 dB/octave, the mid
at 3.0 dB/octave, and the high at 6.0 dB/octave.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SCALEMAP=nn/nn/nn/&#8230;&#8203;
The scale map list is a way of controlling which notes are played by Id
and only has any effect if note quantisation is switched on in the basic
sound parameters screen.  It can be very useful when the polyphony is up
and the chords you&#8217;re getting are more like dischords. :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way it works is this: When a sound is played with frequency
quantisation on its frequency is rounded to the nearest 'proper' note on
the musical scale, this note number is then looked up in the scale map
table and substituted by the note indicated in that entry of the table.
The end result of this is that, for instance, using this sequence of
numbers as a scale map:
2,2,4,4,4,7,7,9,9,11,11,11
Will ensure that Id uses only the black notes on the keyboard, just the
sharps and flats for a vaguely oriental feel (to my western ears anyway
:-) ).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above probably appears to be sheer gobbledegook at first reading,
sorry, but if you keep at it you&#8217;ll unlock this powerful feature for
keeping your fractals melodic.  (Unless you&#8217;re totally turned on by
microtonal frequencies in which case forget all this quantisation
nonsense and tune in to the true sound of chaos!)</p>

release portions of the envelope are represented by ADSR, this is what
happens:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the note is first triggered on the volume rises to peak volume at a
rate determined by the attack value.</p>

<p>3D=Yes
3D=Overlay
Resets all 3D parameters to default values.  If "filename=" is given,
forces a restore to be performed in 3D mode (handy when used with

come before any other 3D parameters on the command line or in a
parameter file entry.  The form "3d=overlay" is identical except that
the previous graphics screen is not cleared, as with the <kbd>#</kbd> (<span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></span>)

<div class="paragraph">
<p>RANDOMIZE=nnn (0 - 100)
This feature randomly varies the color of a pixel to near by colors.
Useful to minimize map banding in 3D transformations.  Usable with all
filltypes.  "0" disables, the maximum value is 7.  Try 3 - 5.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AMBIENT=nnn (0 - 100)
Set the depth of the shadows when using full color and light source
filltypes.  "0" disables the function, higher values lower the contrast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FULLCOLOR=yes
Valid with any light source filltype.  Allows you to create a Targa-24
file which uses the color of the image being transformed or the map you
select and shades it as you would see it in real life.  Well, its better
than B&amp;W.  A good map file to use is topo.map.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HAZE=nnn (0 - 100)
Gives more realistic terrains by setting the amount of haze for distant
objects when using full color in light source FILLTYPES.  Works only in
the "y" direction currently, so don&#8217;t use it with much y rotation.  Try
"rotation=85/0/0".  0 disables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BACKGROUND=nn/nn/nn
Sets the background color of the Targa-24 file by setting the red,
green, and blue values (rr/gg/bb).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LIGHTNAME=&lt;filename&gt;
The name of the Targa-24 file to be created when using full color with
light source.  Default is light001.tga.  If "overwrite=no" (the
default), the file name will be incremented until an unused filename is
found.  Background in this file will be the color set by
background=r/g/b, the default is sky blue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>STEREOWIDTH=&lt;nnn&gt;

<h3 id="_batch_mode">Batch Mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible, believe it or not, to become so jaded with the screen
drawing process, so familiar with the types and options, that you just
want to hit a key and do something else until the final images are safe
on disk.  To do this, start Id with the "batch=yes" parameter.  To set
up a batch run with the parameters required for a particular image you
might:
  * Find an interesting area.  Note the parameters from the <kbd>Tab</kbd>
    display.  Then use an editor to write a batch file.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find an interesting area.  Set all the options you&#8217;ll want in the
batch run.  Use the <kbd>B</kbd> command to store the parameters in a file.
Then use an editor to add the additional required batch mode
parameters (such as "video=") to the generated parameter file entry.
Then run the batch using "id @myname.par/myentry" (if you told the
<kbd>B</kbd> command to use file "myname" and to name the entry "myentry").</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another approach to batch mode calculations, using "filename=" and
resume, is described later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When modifying a parameter file entry generated by the <kbd>B</kbd> command, the
only parameters you must add for a batch mode run are "batch=yes", and
"video=xxx" to select a video mode.  You might want to also add
"savename=[name]" to name the result as something other than the default
fract001.gif.  Or, you might find it easier to leave the generated
parameter file unchanged and add these parameters by using a command
like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>id @myname.par/myentry batch=y video=AF3 savename=mygif</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parameter "batch=yes" tells Id to run in batch mode&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, Id
draws the image using whatever other parameters you specified, then acts
as if you had hit <kbd>S</kbd> to save the image, then exits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parameter "filename=" can be used with "batch=yes" to resume
calculation of an incomplete image.  For instance, you might
interactively find an image you like; then select some slow options (a
high resolution disk video mode, distance estimator method, high
maxiter, or whatever); start the calculation; then interrupt immediately
with a <kbd>S</kbd>ave.  Rename the save file (fract001.gif if it is the first in
the session and you didn&#8217;t name it with the <kbd>X</kbd> options or "savename=")
to xxx.gif.  Later you can run Id in batch mode to finish the job:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>id batch=yes filename=xxx savename=xxx</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parameter "savetime=nnn" is useful with long batch calculations, to
store a checkpoint every nnn minutes.  If you start a many hour
calculation with say "savetime=60", and a power failure occurs during
the calculation, you&#8217;ll have lost at most an hour of work on the image.
You can resume calculation from the save file as above.  Automatic saves
triggered by savetime do not increment the save file name.  The same
file is overwritten by each auto save until the image completes.  But
note that Id does not directly over-write save files.  Instead, each
save operation writes a temporary file id.tmp, then deletes the prior
save file, then renames id.tmp to be the new save file.  This protects
against power failures which occur during a save operation - if such a
power failure occurs, the prior save file is intact and there&#8217;s a
harmless incomplete id.tmp on your disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to spread a many-hour image over multiple bits of free
machine time you could use a command like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>id batch=yes filename=xxx savename=xxx savetime=60 video=F3</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this batch is running, hit <kbd>S</kbd> (almost any key actually) to tell
Id to save what it has done so far and give your machine back.  A status
code of 2 is returned by Id to the batch file.  Kick off the batch again
when you have another time slice for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the savetime parameter is negative, Id will save the image after
the requested time and exit.  This is useful in batch files where you
want to generate several images with a time limit on each image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While running a batch file, pressing any key will cause Id to exit with
a status code of 2.  Any error that interrupts an image save to disk
will cause an exit with status code 2.  Any error that prevents an image
from being generated will cause an exit with status code 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The savetime= parameter, and batch resumes of partial calculations, only
work with fractal types which can be resumed.  See

This parameter determines how small the image would have to be onscreen
before the browser decides not to include it in the selection of files.
The size is entered in decimal pixels so, for instance, this could be
set to 0.2 to allow images that are up to around three maximum zooms
away (depending on the current video resolution) to be loaded instantly.
Set this to 0 to enable all sub images to be detected.  This can lead to
a very cluttered screen!  The primary use is in conjunction with the
search file mask (see below) to allow location of high magnification
images within an overall view (like the whole Mandelbrot set).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Smallest box"
This determines when the image location is shown as crosshairs rather
than a rather small box.  Set this according to how good your eyesight
is (probably worse than before you started staring at fractals all the
time :-)) or the resolution of your screen.  WARNING the crosshairs
routine centers the cursor on one corner of the image box at the moment
so this looks misleading if set too large.
"Search Mask"
Sets the file name pattern which the browser searches, this can be used
to search out the location of a file by setting this to the filename and
setting smallest image to 0 (see above).</p>

<p>PERIODICITY=no|show|nnn
Controls periodicity checking (see <a href="#_periodicity_logic">Periodicity Logic</a>).  "no" turns it
off, "show" lets you see which pixels were painted as "inside" due to
being caught by periodicity.  Specifying a number causes a more
conservative periodicity test (each increase of 1 divides test tolerance
by 2).  Entering a negative number lets you turn on "show" with that
number.  Note: "type=lambdafn" with "function=exp" needs periodicity
turned off to be accurate&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there may be other cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A non-zero value of the "periodicity=" option causes "passes=o" to not
plot orbits that have reached the bailout conditions or where an orbit
goes off the visible area of the image.  A zero value of periodicity
will plot all orbits except as modified by orbitdelay and orbitinterval.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>ORBITDELAY=&lt;nn&gt;
This option controls how many orbits are computed before the orbits are
displayed on the screen when using the "passes=o" option, or the fractal
types mandelcloud and dynamic.  This allows the orbits to settle down
before plotting starts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option also slows down the display of orbits using the <kbd>O</kbd> command
for folks with hot new computers.  Units are in 1/10000 seconds per
orbit point.  "orbitdelay=10" therefore allows you to see each pixel&#8217;s
orbit point for about one millisecond.  For best display of orbits, try
"passes=1" and a moderate resolution such as 800x600.  Note that the
first time you press the <kbd>O</kbd> key with the orbitdelay function active,
your computer will pause for a half-second or so to calibrate a high-
resolution timer.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>ORBITINTERVAL=&lt;nn&gt;

from 1, which plots every orbit, to 255, which plots every 255th orbit.
This value must be lower than the value of maxit to make any sense.</p>

<h3 id="_disk_video_modes">"Disk-Video" Modes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These "video modes" do not involve a graphic display at all.  They use
memory or your disk drive (as file id.$$$) to store the fractal image.
These modes are useful for creating images beyond the size of your
screen, right up to the current internal limit of 32767 x 32767 x 256,
e.g. for subsequent printing.  They&#8217;re also useful for background
processing - create an image in a disk-video mode, save it, then restore
it in a real video mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While you are using a disk-video mode, your screen will display text
information indicating whether memory or your disk drive is being used,
and what portion of the "screen" is being read from or written to.  A
"Cache size" figure is also displayed. 64K is the maximum cache size.
With a very low cache size such as 4 or 6k, performance gets
considerably worse in cases using solid guessing, boundary tracing,
plasma, or anything else which paints the screen non-linearly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The zoom box is disabled during disk-video modes (you couldn&#8217;t see where

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_before_mandelbrot">Before Mandelbrot</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like new forms of life, new branches of mathematics and science don&#8217;t
appear from nowhere.  The ideas of fractal geometry can be traced to the
late nineteenth century, when mathematicians created shapes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sets of
points&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that seemed to have no counterpart in nature.  By a wonderful
irony, the "abstract" mathematics descended from that work has now
turned out to be more appropriate than any other for describing many
natural shapes and processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised.  The Greek geometers worked out the
mathematics of the conic sections for its formal beauty; it was two
thousand years before Copernicus and Brahe, Kepler and Newton overcame
the preconception that all heavenly motions must be circular, and found
the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola in the paths of planets, comets,
and projectiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the 17th century Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz created
calculus, with its techniques for "differentiating" or finding the
derivative of functions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in geometric terms, finding the tangent of a
curve at any given point.  True, some functions were discontinuous, with
no tangent at a gap or an isolated point.  Some had singularities:
abrupt changes in direction at which the idea of a tangent becomes
meaningless.  But these were seen as exceptional, and attention was
focused on the "well-behaved" functions that worked well in modeling
nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beginning in the early 1870s, though, a 50-year crisis transformed
mathematical thinking.  Karl Weierstrass described a function that was
continuous but nondifferentiable&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no tangent could be described at any
point.  Georg Cantor showed how a simple, repeated procedure could turn
a line into a dust of scattered points, and Peano generated a convoluted
curve that eventually touches every point on a plane.  These shapes
seemed to fall between the usual categories of one-dimensional lines,
two-dimensional planes and three-dimensional volumes.  Most still saw
them as pathological cases, but here and there they began to find
applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other areas of mathematics, too, strange shapes began to crop up.
Henri Poincare attempted to analyze the stability of the solar system in
the 1880s and found that the many-body dynamical problem resisted
traditional methods.  Instead, he developed a qualitative approach, a
state space in which each point represented a different planetary orbit,
and studied what we would now call the topology&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the connectedness&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;of whole families of orbits.  This approach revealed that while many
initial motions quickly settled into the familiar curves, there were
also strange, chaotic orbits that never became periodic and predictable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other investigators trying to understand fluctuating, noisy phenomena&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the flooding of the Nile, price series in economics, the jiggling of
molecules in Brownian motion in fluids&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;found that traditional models
could not match the data.  They had to introduce apparently arbitrary
scaling features, with spikes in the data becoming rarer as they grew
larger, but never disappearing entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For many years these developments seemed unrelated, but there were
tantalizing hints of a common thread.  Like the pure mathematicians'
curves and the chaotic orbital motions, the graphs of irregular time
series often had the property of self-similarity: a magnified small
section looked very similar to a large one over a wide range of scales.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_who_is_this_guy_anyway">Who Is This Guy, Anyway?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While many pure and applied mathematicians advanced these trends, it is
Benoit Mandelbrot above all who saw what they had in common and pulled
the threads together into the new discipline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He was born in Warsaw in 1924, and moved to France in 1935.  In a time
when French mathematical training was strongly analytic, he visualized
problems whenever possible, so that he could attack them in geometric
terms.  He attended the Ecole Polytechnique, then Caltech, where he
encountered the tangled motions of fluid turbulence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1958 he joined IBM, where he began a mathematical analysis of
electronic noise&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and began to perceive a structure in it, a hierarchy
of fluctuations of all sizes, that could not be explained by existing
statistical methods.  Through the years that followed, one seemingly
unrelated problem after another was drawn into the growing body of ideas
he would come to call fractal geometry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As computers gained more graphic capabilities, the skills of his mind&#8217;s
eye were reinforced by visualization on display screens and plotters.
Again and again, fractal models produced results&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;series of flood
heights, or cotton prices&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that experts said looked like "the real
thing."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Visualization was extended to the physical world as well.  In a
provocative essay titled "How Long Is the Coast of Britain?", Mandelbrot
noted that the answer depends on the scale at which one measures: it
grows longer and longer as one takes into account every bay and inlet,
every stone, every grain of sand.  And he codified the self-similarity
characteristic of many fractal shapes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the reappearance of
geometrically similar features at all scales.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First in isolated papers and lectures, then in two editions of his
seminal book, "The Fractal Geometry of Nature", he argued that many of
science&#8217;s traditional mathematical models are ill-suited to natural
forms and processes: in fact, that many of the pathological shapes
mathematicians had discovered generations before are useful
approximations of tree bark and lung tissue, clouds and galaxies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mandelbrot was named an IBM Fellow in 1974, and continued to work at the
IBM Watson Research Center until 1987 when IBM ended pure research in
his division.  He joined the Department of Mathematics at Yale
University and obtained his first tenured position in 1999 at the age of
75.  At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was Sterling Professor of
Mathematical Sciences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mandelbrot died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 85 in Cambridge,
Massachusetts on October 14th, 2010.  Reacting to news of his death,
mathematician Heinz-Otto Peitgen said:</p>

<h4 id="_periodicity_logic">Periodicity Logic</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Mandelbrot lake" in the center of the M-set images is the
traditional bane of plotting programs.  It sucks up the most computer
time because it always reaches the iteration limit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and yet the most
interesting areas are invariably right at the edge the lake.  (See
<a href="#_the_mandelbrot_set">The Mandelbrot Set</a> for a description of the iteration process.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to Mark Peterson for pointing out (well, he more like beat us
over the head until we paid attention) that the iteration values in the
middle of Mandelbrot Lake tend to decay to periodic loops (i.e., Z(n+m)
== Z(n), a fact that is pointed out on pages 58-61 of "The Beauty of
Fractals").  An intelligent program (like the one he wrote) would check
for this periodicity once in a while, recognize that iterations caught
in a loop are going to max out, and bail out early.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For speed purposes, the current version of the program turns this
checking algorithm on only if the last pixel generated was in the lake.
(The checking itself takes a small amount of time, and the pixels on the
very edge of the lake tend to decay to periodic loops very slowly, so
this compromise turned out to be the fastest generic answer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try a full M-set plot with a 1000-iteration maximum with any other
program, and then try it on this one for a pretty dramatic proof of the
value of periodicity checking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can get a visual display of the periodicity effects if you press
<kbd>O</kbd>rbits while plotting.  This toggles display of the intermediate
iterations during the generation process.  It also gives you an idea of
how much work your poor little PC is going through for you!  If you use
this toggle, it&#8217;s best to disable solid-guessing first using <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd>
because in its second pass, solid-guessing bypasses many of the pixel
calculations precisely where the orbits are most interesting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_arbitrary_precision_and_deep_zooming">Arbitrary Precision and Deep Zooming</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The zoom limit of Id is approximately 10^15 (10 to the fifteenth power).
This limit is due to the precision possible with the computer
representation of numbers as 64 bit double precision data.  To give you
an idea of just how big a magnification 10^15 is, consider this.  At the
scale of your computer screen while displaying a tiny part of the
Mandelbrot set at the deepest possible zoom, the entire Mandelbrot set
would be many millions of miles wide, as big as the orbit of Jupiter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Big as this zoom magnification is, your PC can do better using something
called arbitrary precision math.  Instead of using 64 bit double
precision to represent numbers, your computer software allocates as much
memory as needed to create a data type supporting as many decimals of
precision as you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incorporation of this feature in Id was inspired by Jay Hill and his
DeepZoom program which uses the shareware MFLOAT programming library.
Several of the Stone Soup programmers noticed Jay&#8217;s posts in the
Internet sci.fractals newsgroup and began to investigate adding
arbitrary precision to Id.  High school math and physics teacher Wes
Loewer wrote an arbitrary precision library, and the Stone Soup team
incorporated Wes&#8217;s library into Id&#8217;s predecessor.  Initially, support
was added for fractal types mandel, julia, manzpower, and julzpower.
Later, support for the fractal type dividebrot5 was added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, when you reach Id&#8217;s zoom limit, Id simply refuses to let you
zoom any more.  When using the fractal types that support arbitrary
precision, you will not reach this limit, but can keep on zooming.  When
you pass the threshold between double precision and arbitrary precision,
Id will dramatically slow down.  The <kbd>Tab</kbd> status screen can be used to
verify that Id is indeed using arbitrary precision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fractals with arbitrary precision are slow, as much as ten times slower
than if the math were done with your CPU, and even slower simply because
the zoom depth is greater.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe the real point of arbitrary precision math is to prolong the
"olden" days when men were men, women were women, and real fractal
programmers spent weeks generating fractals.  Computers are getting
faster every day, and soon a new generation of fractal lovers might
forget that fractal generation is supposed to be slow, just as it was in
Grandpa&#8217;s day when they only had Pentium chips.  The solution to this
educational dilemma is Id&#8217;s arbitrary precision feature.  Even the
newest machines are going to have to chug for days or weeks at the
extreme zoom depths now possible &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how far can you zoom?  How does 10^1600 sound&#8212;&#8203;roughly 1600 decimal
digits of precision.  To put this magnification in perspective, the
"tiny" ratio of 10^61 is the ratio of the entire visible universe to the
smallest quantum effects.  With 1600 digits to work with, you can expand
an electron-sized image up to the size of the visible universe, not once
but more than twenty times.  So you can examine screen-sized portions of
a Mandelbrot set so large all but a tiny part of it would be vastly
farther away than the billion or so light year limit of our best
telescopes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lest anyone suppose that we Stone Soupers suffer from an inflated pride
over having thus spanned the universe, current inflationary cosmological
theories estimate the size of the universe to be unimaginably larger
than the tiny part we can see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: many of Id&#8217;s options do not work with arbitrary precision.  To
experiment with arbitrary precision at the speedier ordinary
magnifications, start Id with the debug=3200 command-line option.  With
the exception of mandel, manzpower and dividebrot5 perturbations, values
that would normally be entered in the Parameters and Coordinates screens
need to be entered using the command-line interface or .par files.
Other known things that do not yet work with arbitrary precision are:
biomorph, decomp, distance estimator, inversion, Julia-Mandel switch,
history, orbit-in-window, and the browse feature.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_perturbation_algorithm">Perturbation Algorithm</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The perturbation algorithm was originally implemented in a program
called "SuperFractalThing" by K. I. Martin.  The core observation is
that orbits for nearby points in the complex plane can be related to
each other through a difference equation.  Therefore, if a single orbit
is computed at high precision from a reference point, the values in the
orbits of nearby points can be computed from the reference orbit using
lower precision math.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the essence of how perturbation methods speed up deep zooms of
the Mandelbrot set.  Only a few reference points need to be calculated
at full precision using slower operations and nearby points can be
calculated using faster lesser precision operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the Mandelbrot set, the formula for computing the orbit in the
complex plane is:</p>

<h4 id="_the_id_fractal_engine_architecture">The Id "Fractal Engine" Architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several of the authors would never admit this, but Id has evolved a
powerful and flexible architecture that makes adding new fractals very
easy.  (They would never admit this because they pride themselves on
being the sort that mindlessly but happily hacks away at code and "sees
if it works and doesn&#8217;t hang the machine".)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many fractal calculations work by taking a rectangle in the complex
plane, and, point by point, calculating a color corresponding to that
point.  Furthermore, the color calculation is often done by iterating a
function over and over until some bailout condition is met.  (See
<a href="#_the_mandelbrot_set">The Mandelbrot Set</a> for a description of the iteration process.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In implementing such a scheme, there are three fractal-specific
calculations that take place within a framework that is pretty much the
same for them all.  Rather than copy the same code over and over, we
created a standard fractal engine that calls three functions that may be
bolted in temporarily to the engine.  The bolting in process uses the
C++ language mechanism of variable function pointers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These three functions are:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>1) a setup function that is run once per image, to do any required
initialization of variables,</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>2) a once-per-pixel function that does whatever initialization has to
be done to calculate a color for one pixel, and</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>3) a once-per-orbit-iteration function, which is the fundamental
fractal algorithm that is repeatedly iterated in the fractal
calculation.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The common framework that calls these functions can contain all sorts of
speedups, tricks, and options that the fractal implementor need not
worry about.  All that is necessary is to write the three functions in
the correct way, and bingo!&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all options automatically apply.  What
makes it even easier is that usually one can re-use functions 1) and 2)
written for other fractals, and therefore only need to write function
3).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then it occurred to us that there might be more than one sort of fractal
engine, so we even allowed that to be bolted in.  And we created a data
structure for each fractal that includes pointers to these four
functions, various prompts, a default region of the complex plane, and
various miscellaneous bits of information that allow toggling between
Julia and Mandelbrot or toggling between the various kinds of math used
in implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That sounds pretty flexible, but there is one drawback - you have to be
a C programmer and have a C compiler to make use of it!  So we took
it a step further, and designed a built-in high level compiler, so that
you can enter the formulas for the various functions in a formula file
in a straightforward algebra-like language, and Id will compile them and
bolt them in for you!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a terrible down side to this flexibility.  Id users everywhere
are going berserk.  Fractal-inventing creativity is running rampant.
Proposals for new fractal types are clogging the mail and the
telephones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All we can say is that non-productivity software has never been so
potent, and we&#8217;re sorry, it&#8217;s our fault!</p>

<p><a href="#_ant_automaton">ant</a>
    Generalized Ant Automaton as described in the July, 1994 Scientific
    American.  Some ants wander around the screen.  A rule string (the first
    parameter) determines the ant&#8217;s direction.  When the type 1 ant leaves a
    cell of color k, it turns right if the kth symbol in the first parameter
    is a 1, or left otherwise.  Then the color in the old cell is incremented.
    The 2nd parameter is a maximum iteration to guarantee that the fractal
    will terminate.  The 3rd parameter is the number of ants.  The 4th is the
    ant type 1 or 2.  The 5th parameter determines if the ants wrap the screen
    or stop at the edge.  The 6th parameter is a random seed.  You can slow
    down the ants to see them better using the <kbd>P</kbd> screen Orbit Delay.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an attempted explanation of what the "inside=bof60" and
"inside=bof61" options do.  This explanation is hereby dedicated to
Adrian Mariano, who badgered it out of us!  For the real explanation,
see "Beauty of Fractals", page 62.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let p(z) be the function that is repeatedly iterated to generate a
fractal using the escape-time algorithm.  For example, p(z) = z^2+c in
the case of a Julia set.  Then let pk(z) be the result of iterating the
function p for k iterations.  (The "k" should be shown as a
superscript.)  We could also use the notation pkc(z) when the function p
has a parameter c, as it does in our example.  Now hold your breath and
get your thinking cap on.  Define a(c) = inf{|pkc(0)|:k=1,2,3,&#8230;&#8203;}.  In
English - a(c) is the greatest lower bound of the images of zero of as
many iterations as you like.  Put another way, a(c) is the closest to
the origin any point in the orbit starting with 0 gets.  Then the index
(c) is the value of k (the iteration) when that closest point was
achieved.  Since there may be more than one, index(c) is the least such.
Got it?  Good, because the "Beauty of Fractals" explanation of this, is,
ahhhh, terse!  Now for the punch line.  "Inside=bof60" colors the lake
alternating shades according to the level sets of a(c).  Each band
represents solid areas of the fractal where the closest value of the
orbit to the origin is the same.  "Inside=bof61" show domains where
index(c) is constant.  That is, areas where the iteration when the orbit
swooped closest to the origin has the same value.  Well, folks, that&#8217;s
the best we can do!  Improved explanations will be accepted for the next
edition!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In response to this request for lucidity, Herb Savage offers this
explanation the bof60 and bof61 options:</p>

<pre>The picture on page 60 of The Beauty of Fractals shows the distance to
origin of the closest point to the origin in the sequence of points
generated from a given X,Y coordinate.  The picture on page 61 shows
the index (or number) in the sequence of the closest point.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Inside=zmag" is similar.  This option colors inside pixels according to
the magnitude of the orbit point when maxiter was reached, using the
formula color = (x^2 + y^2) * maxiter/2 + 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Inside=fmod" colors inside pixels according to the magnitude of the
last orbit point which is within a set distance from the origin.  Then:
  color = magnitude * colors / closeprox
The magnitude used for the comparison is now based on the same
calculation as is used for the bailout test.  The value of closeprox can
be varied interactively.  This feature was contributed by Iain Stirling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Inside=period" colors pixels according to the length of their eventual
cycle.  For example, points that approach a fixed point have color=1.
Points that approach a 2-cycle have color=2.  Points that do not
approach a cycle during the iterations performed have color=maxit.  This
option works best with a fairly large number of iterations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Inside=atan" colors by determining the angle in degrees the last
iterated value has with respect to the real axis, and using the absolute
value.  This feature should be used with periodicity=0.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hooper has written a paper entitled "A Note On Some Internal
Structures of the Mandelbrot Set" published in "Computers and Graphics",
Vol 15, No.2, pp. 295-297.  In that article he describes Clifford
Pickover&#8217;s epsilon cross method which creates some mysterious plant-like
tendrils in the Mandelbrot set.  The algorithm is this.  In the escape-
time calculation of a fractal, if the orbit comes within .01 of the Y-
axis, the orbit is terminated and the pixel is colored green.
Similarly, the pixel is colored yellow if it approaches the X-axis.
Strictly speaking, this is not an "inside" option because a point
destined to escape could be caught by this bailout criterion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The test distance, 0.01, can now be changed interactively on the <kbd>X</kbd>
screen and via the "proximity=&lt;nnn&gt;" command line parameter.  A negative
value of the test distance triggers an alternative variation of epsilon
cross that colors the epsilon bands with the iteration; otherwise they
are colored normally to maintain compatibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hooper has another coloring scheme called star trails that involves
detecting clusters of points being traversed by the orbit.  A table of
tangents of each orbit point is built, and the pixel colored according
to how many orbit points are near the first one before the orbit flies
out of the cluster.  This option looks fine with maxiter=16, which
greatly speeds the calculation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these options should be tried with the outside color fixed
("outside=&lt;nnn&gt;") so that the lake structure revealed by the algorithms
can be more clearly seen.  Epsilon cross is fun to watch with boundary
tracing turned on - even though the result is incorrect it is
interesting!  Shucks - what does "incorrect" mean in chaos theory
anyway?!</p>

<h3 id="_finite_attractors">Finite Attractors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of Id&#8217;s fractals involve the iteration of functions of complex
numbers until some bailout value is exceeded, then coloring the
associated pixel according to the number of iterations performed.  This
process identifies which values tend to infinity when iterated, and
gives us a rough measure of how quickly they get there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In dynamical terms, we say that infinity is an attractor, as many
initial values get attracted to it when iterated.  The set of all points
that are attracted to infinity is termed the basin of attraction of
infinity.  The coloring algorithm used divides this basin of attraction
into many distinct sets, each a single band of one color, representing
all the points that are attracted to infinity at the same rate.  These
sets (bands of color) are termed level sets - all points in such a set
are at the same level away from the attractor, in terms of numbers of
iterations required to exceed the bailout value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, Id produces colored images of the level sets of the basin of
attraction of infinity, for all fractals that iterate functions of
complex numbers, at least.  Now we have a sound mathematical definition
of what Id&#8217;s bailout processing generates, and we have formally
introduced the terms attractor, basin of attraction, and level set, so
you should have little trouble following the rest of this section!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For certain Julia-type fractals, Id can also display the level sets of
basins of attraction of finite attractors.  This capability is a by-
product of the implementation of the magnetic fractal types, which
always have at least one finite attractor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option can be invoked by setting the "Look for finite attractor"
option on the <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen, or by giving the "finattract=yes"
command-line option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most Julia-types that have a lake (normally colored blue by default)
have a finite attractor within this lake, and the lake turns out to be,
quite appropriately, the basin of attraction of this attractor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "finattract=yes" option (command-line or <kbd>Y</kbd> options screen)
instructs Id to seek out and identify a possible finite attractor and,
if found, to display the level sets of its basin of attraction, in
addition to those of the basin of attraction of infinity.  In many cases
this results in a lake with colored waves in it;  in other cases there
may be little change in the lake&#8217;s appearance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a quick demonstration, select a fractal type of lambda, with a
parameter of 0.5 + 0.5i.  You will obtain an image with a large blue
lake.  Now set "Look for finite attractor" to 1 with the <kbd>Y</kbd> menu.  The
image will be re-drawn with a much more colorful lake.  A finite
attractor lives in the center of one of the resulting ripple patterns in
the lake - turn the <kbd>O</kbd>rbits display on to see where it is - the orbits
of all initial points that are in the lake converge there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id tests for the presence of a finite attractor by iterating a critical
value of the fractal&#8217;s function.  If the iteration doesn&#8217;t bail out
before exceeding twice the iteration limit, it is almost certain that we
have a finite attractor - we assume that we have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next we define a small circle around it and, after each iteration, as
well as testing for the usual bailout value being exceeded, we test to
see if we&#8217;ve hit the circle.  If so, we bail out and color our pixels
according to the number of iterations performed.  Result - a nicely
colored-in lake that displays the level sets of the basin of attraction
of the finite attractor.  Sometimes!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, this does not work for the lakes of Mandel-types.  Every point in
a Mandel-type is, in effect, a single point plucked from one of its
related Julia-types.  A Mandel-type&#8217;s lake has an infinite number of
points, and thus an infinite number of related Julia-type sets, and
consequently an infinite number of finite attractors too.  It may be
possible to color in such a lake, by determining the attractor for every
pixel, but this would probably treble (at least) the number of
iterations needed to draw the image.  Due to this overhead, finite
attractor logic has not been implemented for Mandel-types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, certain Julia-types with lakes may not respond to this
treatment, depending on the parameter value used.  E.g., the lambda set
for 0.5 + 0.5i responds well; the lambda set for 0.0 + 1.0i does not -
its lake stays blue.  Attractors that consist of single points, or a
cycle of a finite number of points are ok.  Others are not.  If you&#8217;re
into fractal technospeak, the implemented approach fails if the Julia-
type is a parabolic case, or has Siegel disks, or has Herman rings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, all the difficult cases have one thing in common - they all
have a parameter value that falls exactly on the edge of the related
Mandel-type&#8217;s lake.  You can avoid them by intelligent use of the
Mandel-Julia Space-Bar toggle:  Pick a view of the related Mandel-type
where the center of the screen is inside the lake, but not too close to
its edge, then use the space-bar toggle.  You should obtain a usable
Julia-type with a lake, if you follow this guideline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third, the initial implementation only works for Julia-types that use
the standard fractal engine in Id.  Fractals with their own special
algorithms are not affected by finite attractor logic, as yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the finite attractor code will not work if it fails to detect a
finite attractor.  If the number of iterations is set too low, the
finite attractor may be missed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite these restrictions, the finite attractor logic can produce
interesting results.  Just bear in mind that it is principally a bonus
off-shoot from the development of the magnetic fractal types, and is not
specifically tuned for optimal performance for other Julia types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Thanks to Kevin Allen for the above).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a second type of finite attractor coloring, which is selected
by setting "Look for Finite Attractor" to a negative value.  This colors
points by the phase of the convergence to the finite attractor, instead
of by the speed of convergence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, consider the Julia set for -0.1 + 0.7i, which is the three-
lobed rabbit set.  The finite attractor is an orbit of length three;
call these values a, b, and c.  Then, the Julia set iteration can
converge to one of three sequences: a,b,c,a,b,c,&#8230;&#8203;, or b,c,a,b,c,&#8230;&#8203;,
or c,a,b,c,a,b,&#8230;&#8203;  The finite attractor phase option colors the
interior of the Julia set with three colors, depending on which of the
three sequences the orbit converges to.  Internally, the code determines
one point of the orbit, say a, and the length of the orbit cycle, say 3.
It then iterates until the sequence converges to a, and then uses the
iteration number modulo 3 to determine the color.</p>

[((x-w)<sup>2+(y+z)</sup>2)((x+w)<sup>2+(y-z)</sup>2)].  So when this quantity is zero,
the multiplicative inverse will not exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hypercomplex numbers have an elegant generalization of any unary complex
valued function defined on the complex numbers.  First, note that
hypercomplex numbers can be represented as a pair of complex numbers in
the following way.
Let h = x + yi + zj + wk.
    a = (x-w) + i(y+z)
    b = (x+w) + i(y-z)
The numbers a and b are complex numbers.  We can represent h as the pair
of complex numbers (a,b).  Conversely, if we have a hypercomplex number
given to us in the form (a,b), we can solve for x, y, z, and w.  The
solution to
   c = (x-w) + i(y+z)
   d = (x+w) + i(y-z)
is
   x = (real(c) + real(d))/2
   y = (imag(c) + imag(d))/2
   z = (imag(c) - imag(d))/2
   w = (real(d) - real(c))/2
We can now, for example, compute sin(h).  First compute the two complex
numbers a and b as above, then set c = sin(a) and d = sin(b) where sin()
is the complex version of the sin function.  Now use the equations above
to solve for x, y, z, and w in terms of c and d.  The hypercomplex
number (x,y,z,w) thus obtained is sin(h).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The beauty of this is that it really doesn&#8217;t make any difference what
function we use.  Instead of sin, we could have used cos, sinh, ln, or
z^2.  Using this technique, Id can create 3D fractals using the formula
h' = fn(h) + c, where "fn" is any of the built-in functions.  Where fn
is sqr(), this is the famous mandelbrot formula, generalized to four
dimensions.</p>

<h3 id="_the_stone_soup_story">The Stone Soup Story</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once upon a time, somewhere in Eastern Europe, there was a great famine.
People jealously hoarded whatever food they could find, hiding it even
from their friends and neighbors.  One day a peddler drove his wagon
into a village, sold a few of his wares, and began asking questions as
if he planned to stay for the night.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"There&#8217;s not a bite to eat in the whole province", he was told. "Better
keep moving on."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Oh, I have everything I need", he said.  "In fact, I was thinking of
making some stone soup to share with all of you."  He pulled an iron
cauldron from his wagon, filled it with water, and built a fire under
it.  Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a
velvet bag and dropped it into the water.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come to the
square or watched from their windows.  As the peddler sniffed the
"broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome
their skepticism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ahh", the peddler said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty
stone soup.  Of course, stone soup with cabbage&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that&#8217;s hard to beat."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a cabbage he&#8217;d retrieved
from its hiding place, and added it to the pot.  "Capital!" cried the
peddler.  "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of
salt beef as well, and it was fit for a king."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The village butcher managed to find some salt beef&#8230;&#8203;and so it went,
through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was
indeed a delicious meal for all.  The villagers offered the peddler a
great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell and
traveled on the next day.  And from that time on, long after the famine
had ended, they reminisced about the finest soup they&#8217;d ever had.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the way Id has grown, with quite a bit of magic, although without
the element of deception.  (You don&#8217;t have to deceive programmers to
make them think that hours of painstaking, often frustrating work is
fun&#8230;&#8203; they do it to themselves.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have happened, of course, without Benoit Mandelbrot and the
explosion of interest in fractal graphics that has grown from his work
at IBM.  Or without the example of other Mandelplotters for the PC.  Or
without those wizards who first realized you could perform Mandelbrot
calculations using integer math (it wasn&#8217;t us - we just recognize good
algorithms when we steal&#8212;&#8203;uhh&#8212;&#8203;see them).  Or those graphics experts who
hang around the CompuServe PICS forum and keep adding video modes to the
program.  Or&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<h3 id="_a_word_about_the_authors">A Word About the Authors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Id&#8217;s ancestor, Fractint 20.04, is the result of a synergy between the
main authors, many contributors, and published sources.  All of the main
authors have had a hand in many aspects of the code.  However, each
author has certain areas of greater contribution and creativity.  Since
there is not room in the credits screen for the contributions of the
main authors, we list them here to further elaborate on their
contributions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_main_author_of_iterated_dynamics">Main Author of Iterated Dynamics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Richard Thomson is the main author of Id.  The Fractint code had
languished for many years, struggling to leave its DOS nest.  This has
resulted other fractal renderers passing it by as they adopted SIMD
parallelism, GPU computation and fancy perturbation methods to eclipse
its computational speed.  Richard felt the investment in so many fractal
types, and the extensive online help, couldn&#8217;t just be left to rot and
the code needed to move forward to a modern environment.  Particularly
the IFS, L-system and cellular automata types deserve to have a modern
home as they are often omitted by other fractal rendering programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Richard forked the code from Subversion to the github repository.  There
are barely any lines of code that weren&#8217;t touched by him after the fork
from Fractint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Richard decoupled the DOS and assembly language code from the rest of
the code and created a driver abstraction that could be used to connect
the code to modern environments.  He implemented the disk and gdi
drivers for Win32 used to provide their correspnding video modes.  The
CGA text window is emulated in order to have the user interface and help
system.  He converted the entirety of the code to C++ to allow object
oriented programming paradigms to be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many magic numbers throughout the code were replaced with enums or other
symbolic names to make it easier to understand how these values and
flags are used throughout.  Many times an integer quantity was being
used as a boolean on/off switch and those integer variables were
replaced with boolean variables to make the intent more clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the years, the code has accumulated a large number of global
variables through which the various functions communicate.  Global
variables have been renamed to start with a g_ prefix and variables with
a file scope, e.g. static variables, were renamed to start with an s_
prefix.  This makes it easier to understand the scope of variables when
reading a particular piece of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Functions and variables were placed together into source files in order
to suit the cramped memory limitations of DOS using overlays.  Sometimes
you have to break things down into isolated pieces before you can begin
to see which ones are intimately connected to each other.  For the
largest source files containing multiple functions, the individual
functions were split into their own source and header files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He implemented the CMake based build system from scratch.  He used the
vcpkg package manager for C++ to allow Id to easily consume third party
libraries for new features.  One of the first libraries used was Google
Test, bringing unit testing to the code for the first time.  Making
changes to the code requires careful attention to detail in how all
these variables interact with each other.  Unit testing changes before
applying them helps ensure that forward progress doesn&#8217;t come at the
expense of bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Github&#8217;s actions provide continuous integration (CI) builds on Windows
and linux with every commit to the repository.  The actions build all
the code and run all the unit tests every time the repository is
updated.  Richard uses Windows as his primary development environment
and the CI builds ensure that the code continues to build on linux.
(This trips you up more often than you might think!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other libraries Richard has brought in are the boost.algorithm library
for some string algorithms, the boost.endian library for marshalling the
GIF extension blocks between little and big endian machines and the
giflib library for reading and writing GIF files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 2017 version of the ISO C++ language standard is required to build
Id.  This is readily available through open source compilers on unix,
such as gcc and clang, and on Windows through Visual Studio Community
Edition.  Visual Studio Community Edition is a full-featured compiler
and development environment with no license restrictions.  It can be
downloaded from <a href="https://VisualStudio.com" class="bare">https://VisualStudio.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every line of the help files were examined and updated to have a
consistent style throughout.  Discussion of old DOS related information
was removed and, where appropriate, replaced with relevant discussion of
operating in a Windowed environment.  Stale links to web sites have been
removed.  The original help came from a more innocent time on the
internet when people weren&#8217;t afraid to post their phone numbers and home
addresses.  That personal information has been removed from the help
files and only Richard&#8217;s personal email address has been left.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Richard has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from
the University of Delaware and a Master of Philosophy degree in Computer
Science from the University of Utah.  From 2000 to 2010, he was a
Microsoft MVP for Direct3D and wrote a book on the Direct3D APIs.  The
book, "The Direct3D Graphics Pipeline", is available free download at

and currently works on hardware accelerated ray tracing.</p>

<h3 id="_main_authors_of_fractint">Main Authors of Fractint</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bert Tyler is the original author of Fractint.  He wrote the "blindingly
fast" 386-specific 32 bit integer math code and the original video mode
logic.  Bert made Stone Soup possible, and provides a sense of direction
when we need it.  His forte is writing fast 80x86 assembler, his
knowledge of a variety of video hardware, and his skill at hacking up
the code we send him!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bert has a BA in mathematics from Cornell University.  He has been in
programming since he got a job at the computer center in his sophomore
year at college - in other words, he hasn&#8217;t done an honest day&#8217;s work in
his life.  He has been known to pass himself off as a PC expert, a Unix
expert, a statistician, and even a financial modeling expert.  He is
currently masquerading as an independent PC consultant, supporting the
PC-to-Mainframe communications environment at NIH.  If you sent mail
from the Internet to an NIH staffer on his 3+Mail system, it was
probably Bert&#8217;s code that mangled it during the Internet-to-3+Mail
conversion.  He also claims to support the MS-Kermit environment at NIH.
Fractint is Bert&#8217;s first effort at building a graphics program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tim Wegner contributed the original implementation of palette animation,
and is responsible for most of the 3D mechanisms.  He provided the main
outlines of the "Standard Fractal" engine and data structures, and is
accused by his cohorts of being "obsessed with options".  One of Tim&#8217;s
main interests is the use of four dimensional algebras to produce
fractals.  Tim served as team coordinator for version 19, and integrated
Wes Loewer&#8217;s arbitrary precision library into Fractint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tim has BA and MA degrees in mathematics from Carleton College and the
University of California Berkeley.  He worked for 7 years overseas as a
volunteer, doing things like working with Egyptian villagers building
water systems.  Since returning to the US in 1982, he has written
shuttle navigation software, a software support environment prototype,
and supported strategic information planning, all at NASA&#8217;s Johnson
Space Center.  After a two-year stint at full-time writing, he&#8217;s back at
NASA developing shuttle navigation software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jonathan Osuch started throwing pebbles into the soup around version
15.0 with a method for simulating an if-then-else structure using the
formula parser.  He has contributed the fn||fn fractal types, the built-
in bailout tests, the increase in both the maximum iteration count and
bailout value, and bug fixes too numerous to count.  Jonathan worked
closely with Robin Bussell to implement Robin&#8217;s browser mechanism in
Fractint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jonathan has a B.S. in Physics from the University of Dubuque and a B.S.
in Computer Science from Mount Mercy College, both in Iowa.  He is
currently working as a consultant in the nuclear power industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wes Loewer first got his foot in the Stone Soup door by writing fast
floating point assembler routines for Mandelbrot, Julia, and Lyapunov
fractals.  He also rewrote the boundary trace algorithms and added the
frothybasin fractal.  His most significant contribution is the addition
of the arbitrary precision library which allows Fractint to perform
incredibly deep zooms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wes has a B.S. in Physics from Wheaton College in Illinois.  He also
holds an M.S. in Physics and an M.Ed. in Education from Texas A&amp;M
University.  Wes teaches physics and math at McCullough High School in
The Woodlands, Texas where his pupils inspire him to keep that sense of
amazement that students get when they understand a physical or
mathematical principle for the first time.  Since he uses Fractint to
help teach certain mathematical principles, he&#8217;s one of the few folks
who actually gets to use Fractint on the job.  Besides his involvement
with Fractint, Wes is the author of WL-Plot, an equation graphing
program, and MatCalc, a matrix calculator program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>George Martin first became known to Fractint users when he brought a
modicum of order to the chaotic world of formula postings with his
release of the Orgform program and formula compilation.  George added
if..else to the formula parser language for version 19.6.  Among his
other contributions are the ability to include formula, ifs, and lsystem
entries in .par files, the scrolling of text in the <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>F2</kbd>
screens, and new autokey commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>George received an A.B. in Economics from Dartmouth College and a J.D
from the University of Michigan.  When not playing with Fractint, he
practices law in a small village about 40 miles northwest of Detroit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Robin Bussell began contributing to Fractint in rudimentary fashion with
the autologmap routine and has been producing more and more complex
interface enhancements as he gets better at what he refers to as 'this C
programming lark'.  He is always grateful for the help the rest of the
team have given in smoothing the rough edges of the ingredients he adds
to the soup and regards the evolver feature as his greatest achievement
to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Robin had far too much fun at college in London to actually get any
qualifications there and has since worked his way up from a workshop job
fixing computers back in the final days of CP/M, via some interesting
work with Transputers (an innovative British cpu that was designed to
run in massively parallel configurations, and made a very good
Mandlebrot set calculating machine when a few dozen or more were set to
the task), through to his position of senior engineer for a third party
suppport company where he spends his time travelling the south west of
Britain sorting out peoples IT problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When not playing with computers Robin likes to relax by experimenting
with kite powered traction and can often be found hurtling around the
local beaches on the end of a few square metres of fabric and carbon
fibre in various configurations.</p>

<p>When prompting the user to locate a file, Id now uses the native Windows
Open File dialog.  This replaces a bunch of homebrew code for locating a
file under DOS using the full screen choice mechanism on the text
screens.  There are likely more filesystem related issues that need to
be cleaned up; see issue #268.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version Handling in Version 1.2 Onward</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previous versions of Iterated Dynamics reset the version to 1.0 in a
breaking change from the legacy DOS FRACTINT version numbering.  While
this properly served to indicate the reality of Id being a fork from DOS
FRACTINT, it created some interopability problems with parameter sets
and image files between the two programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When creating a parameter file, the reset parameter is now written as
reset=major/minor/patch/tweak.  The major and minor version components
are always written.  The patch and tweak components appear if either
component is non-zero.  Legacy FRACTINT version numbers, such as
reset=2004, when read from a parameter set are all treated as version
1.0 of Id for the purposes of backward compatibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, no backwards compatibility with old FRACTINT behavior is
applied to parameter sets.  Legacy DOS FRACTINT parameter sets that rely
on the reset parameter to have behavior adjusted may not render
identical images in Id.  Such parameter sets can be upgraded by loading
the parameter set into DOS FRACTINT and either saving an image or
creating a new parameter set in DOS FRACTINT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When reading an image file, integer fractal types are converted to their
corresponding floating-point fractal type.  Legacy FRACTINT version
numbers in image files are used to migrate legacy FRACTINT behavior to
the current behavior in Id.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing an image file, Id writes the full major/minor/patch/tweak
version number into the file and writes a legacy FRACTINT version number
of 20.04.  Such files may load in DOS FRACTINT, but no guarantees of
compatibility with DOS FRACTINT are made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bugs Fixed in Version 1.2</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Id will search standard locations for images specified on the command-
line: current directory, savedir parameter location, and FRACTDIR
environment variable location.  (Fixes #267)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Id could overwrite image files in separate sessions, even when the
overwrite parameter was not set.  Id now properly checks for the
existence of a file in the save location.  (Fixes #264)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File system errors are now properly reported when writing image
parameters.  (Fixes #231)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The orbitname parameter for julibrot types is now documented.  (Fixes
#238)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chip, quadruptwo and threeply types documentation was improved.
(Fixes #252)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.1.1 wrote a version number into image files
that was not compatible with loading into legacy DOS FRACTINT.  That
has been corrected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code Cleanup in Version 1.2</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All integer fractal code paths and associated data have been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bunch of legacy FRACTINT files were removed from the repository.
The remaining files were moved to a directory named 'legacy'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leftover files from the Sphinx version of HTML help have been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More magic value integers were replaced with symbolic constants as
enumerations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New Features in Version 1.1:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ctrl <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> can now be used to rotate the zoom box, in addition
to the numeric keypad <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> keys.  Some laptops don&#8217;t have a
numeric keypad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perturbation drawing algorithm.  Paul de Leeuw contributed an
implementation of the perturbation drawing algorithm with support for
the Mandelbrot (type=mandel) and Mandelbrot power (type=manzpower)
fractal types.  See <a href="#_drawing_method">Drawing Method</a> and <a href="#_perturbation_algorithm">Perturbation Algorithm</a> for
details.  (PR #160)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration files 'sstools.ini' and 'id.cfg' can now be loaded from
outside the installation directory.  The following locations are
searched in this order: user&#8217;s Documents directory, FRACTDIR
environment variable location and then current directory.  The
directory related parameter values do not change this search order.
When video mode key assignments are changed interactively, the updated
id.cfg is written to the location specified by the savedir parameter,
defaulting to the user&#8217;s Documents directory.  Changing function key
assignments while selecting video modes saves the updated id.cfg file
to the savedir, defaulting to the user&#8217;s Documents directory.  (Fixes
#170)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mouse support for the zoom box has been restored. (Fixes #14, #152)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mouse support for the <a href="#_orbits_window">Orbits Window</a> has been restored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mouse support for the inverse Julia set cursor has been restored.
(Fixes #151)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The color palette editor can be positioned using the mouse and the
current pixel whose color is displayed in the editor can also be
selected with the mouse.  (Fixes #150)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disk video rendering performance and robustness improved.  Requested
memory buffers are now unlimited in disk video mode and only fall back
to using a disk file if memory allocation fails.  The operating
system&#8217;s virtual memory will perform better than manual disk caches.
Disk cache files are unique per-process, allowing multiple instances
of Id to be running simultaneously without interfering with each
other.  The the status screen will now update at most ten times per
second.  This prevents GUI updates from being the bottleneck on disk
video rendering.  (Fixes #173, #174)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bugs Fixed in Version 1.1:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When selecting a formula, L-system or IFS fractal type and the item is
wide and/or needs scrolling, such as the Fractint entry of
example2.frm, the surrounding box was improperly displayed.  (Fixes
#182)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The makepar parameter, or <kbd>B</kbd> commnd, now saves any generated
parameter and batch files to the savedir location.  (Fixes #176, #177)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generated parameter file comments now properly handle escaped
backslashes preceding another special character.  (Fixes #175)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The version number is now correctly displayed in the title of help
screens.  (Fixes #154)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When run from the Visual Studio debugger, the working directory of the
program is properly set to the home directory.  (Fixes #153)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corrected an assert popup during a Debug build. (Fixes #147, #140)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the monitor configuration changed since the last time Id was run
and the previous window position is no longer on-screen, the previous
window position is forgotten and the window is placed by the system.
(Fixes #136)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, crash dump files are saved to the savedir location.
(Fixes #133)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When changing fractal types, if the the fractal parameters screen or
entry name screen (for formula, ifs or L-system fractal types) were
cancelled, the previous fractal type and associated parameters were
lost.  Now, canceling those screens restores the previous state.

<p>Fork of Fractint 20.04 patch level 4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New formula file MandelbrotDerivatives.frm with Burning Ship,
Perpendicular Mandelbrot, Heart Mandelbrot, Mandelbar and other

<p>All filename parameters are now case sensitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When browsing for files, e.g. <kbd>R</kbd>estoring *.GIF files, filenames are
compared case insensitive against wildcard search masks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new fractal types <a href="#_mandelbrot_mix_4">Mandelbrot Mix 4</a> and <a href="#_dividebrot5">DivideBrot5</a> by Jim Muth.
DivideBrot5 has arbitrary precision (AP) math support.  Note that
image skewing and inversion are not  supported by the AP math
routines. See <a href="#_arbitrary_precision_and_deep_zooming">Arbitrary Precision and Deep Zooming</a> for other features
not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The orbitsavename parameter was added to specify the name of the raw
orbits file.  The orbits file, if it exists, is overwritten when
overwrite=yes.  Otherwise, the value of orbitsavename is incremented
until a filename is formed that does not exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The autokeyname parameter was enhanced to create a unique filename
when autokey=record unless overwrite=yes is specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disk video buffer sizes were dramatically increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formula parser has been enhanced to remove internal size
limitations.  The only limit on formula parsing is available memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The savedir parameter was added to specify the default directory used
for writing any files.  Since a Windows program is typically installed
to the Program Files directory, which is read-only, it cannot be
assumed that Id can write to the directory in which it is located.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional changes in Version 1.0:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most of the changes involve internal restructuring of the DOS Fractint
code to build a bridge to the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterated Dynamics is a native 64-bit Windows program written in C++
with a CMake build system and vcpkg for obtaining 3rd party library
dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All assembly language code has been removed and, where practical,
replaced with C++ code that performs the same function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A CGA text display is simulated for all prompt screens and help
screens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "video mode" determines the resolution of all saved images and is
provided by a driver.  Iterated Dynamics comes with two drivers: Disk
and GDI.  The GDI driver renders to the screen through the Windows GDI
interface.  The disk driver can be used to render images larger than
your physical screen, but still uses your screen&#8217;s GUI for displaying
status with a CGA style window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Id.cfg, which defines the default video modes, was updated to remove
all modes smaller than 800x600 and very large disk video modes were
added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DOS related information in video modes was dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All online help text has been reviewed and revised to drop DOS
specific discussions.  Where still appropriate the text has been
updated to reflect that Id is a program operating in a windowed
environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The release parameter resets all values to their default but does not
enable any backwards compatible behavior in this release.  For
backward compatability with old behavior, use Fractint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monitorwidth parameter was renamed to stereowidth.  The old
parameter name is still accepted but will be deprecated in a future
release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Printing an image has been removed.  Use your operating system for
that.  :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following parameter file commands are deprecated and support will
be removed in a future release.  In this release the arguments are
parsed and validated and the results ignored.
