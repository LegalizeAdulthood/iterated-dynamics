 2.49 Phoenix

  (type=phoenix, mandphoenix, phoenixcplx, mandphoenixclx)

  The phoenix type defaults to the original phoenix curve discovered by
  Shigehiro Ushiki, "Phoenix", IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems,
  Vol. 35, No. 7, July 1988, pp. 788-789.  These images do not have the X
  and Y axis swapped as is normal for this type.

  The mandphoenix type is the corresponding Mandelbrot set image of the
  phoenix type.  The spacebar toggles between the two as long as the
  mandphoenix type has an initial z(0) of (0,0).  The mandphoenix is not
  an effective index to the phoenix type, so explore the wild blue yonder.

  To reproduce the Mandelbrot set image of the phoenix type as shown in
  Stevens' book, "Fractal Programming in C", set initorbit=0/0 on the
  command line or with the &lt;g&gt; key.  The colors need to be rotated one
  position because Stevens uses the values from the previous calculation
  instead of the current calculation to determine when to bailout.

  The phoenixcplx type is implemented using complex constants instead of
  the real constants that Stevens used.  This recreates the mapping as
  originally presented by Ushiki.

  The mandphoenixclx type is the corresponding Mandelbrot set image of the
  phoenixcplx type.  The spacebar toggles between the two as long as the
  mandphoenixclx type has a perturbation of z(0) = (0,0).  The
  mandphoenixclx is an effective index to the phoenixcplx type.
