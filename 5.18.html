 5.18 3D Parameters

  To stay out of trouble, specify all the 3D parameters, even if you want
  to use what you think are the default values. It takes a little practice
  to learn what the default values really are. The best way to create a
  set of parameters is to use the &lt;B&gt; command on an image you like and
  then use an editor to modify the resulting parameter file.

  3D=Yes
  3D=Overlay
  Resets all 3d parameters to default values. If FILENAME= is given,
  forces a restore to be performed in 3D mode (handy when used with
  'batch=yes' for batch-mode 3D images). If specified, 3D=Yes should come
  before any other 3d parameters on the command line or in a parameter
  file entry. The form 3D=Overlay is identical except that the previous
  graphics screen is not cleared, as with the &lt;#&gt; (&lt;shift-3&gt; on some
  keyboards) overlay command.  Useful for building parameter files that
  use the 3D overlay feature.

  The options below override the 3D defaults:
  PREVIEW=yes                Turns on 3D 'preview' default mode
  SHOWBOX=yes                Turns on 3D 'showbox' default mode
  COARSE=nn                  Sets Preview 'coarseness' default value
  SPHERE=yes                 Turns on spherical projection mode
  STEREO=n                   Selects the type of stereo image creation
  RAY=nnn                    selects raytrace output file format
  BRIEF=yes                  selects brief or verbose file for DKB output
  USEGRAYSCALE=yes           use grayscale as depth instead of color number
  INTEROCULAR=nn             Sets the interocular distance for stereo
  CONVERGE=nn                Determines the overall image separation
  CROP=nn/nn/nn/nn           Trims the edges off stereo pairs
  BRIGHT=nn/nn               Compensates funny glasses filter parameters
  LONGITUDE=nn/nn            Longitude minimum and maximum
  LATITUDE=nn/nn             Latitude minimum and maximum
  RADIUS=nn                  Radius scale factor
  ROTATION=nn[/nn[/nn]]      Rotation about x,y, and z axes
  SCALEZYZ=nn/nn/nn          X,y,and z scale factors
  ROUGHNESS=nn               Same as z scale factor
  WATERLINE=nn               Colors nn and below will be "inside" color
  FILLTYPE=nn                3D filltype
  PERSPECTIVE=nn             Perspective distance
  XYSHIFT=nn/nn              Shift image in x and y directions with
                              perspective
  LIGHTSOURCE=nn/nn/nn       Coordinates for light-source vector
  SMOOTHING=nn               Smooths images in light-source fill modes
  TRANSPARENT=min/max        Defines a range of colors to be treated as
                              "transparent" when &lt;#&gt;Overlaying 3D images.
  XYADJUST=nn/nn             This shifts the image in the x/y dir without
                              perspective

  Below are new commands as of version 14 that support Marc Reinig's
  terrain features.

  RANDOMIZE=nnn (0 - 100)
  This feature randomly varies the color of a pixel to near by colors.
  Useful to minimize map banding in 3d transformations. Usable with all
  FILLTYPES. 0 disables, max values is 7. Try 3 - 5.

  AMBIENT=nnn (0 - 100)
  Set the depth of the shadows when using full color and light source
  filltypes. "0" disables the function, higher values lower the contrast.

  FULLCOLOR=yes
  Valid with any light source FILLTYPE. Allows you to create a Targa-24
  file which uses the color of the image being transformed or the map you
  select and shades it as you would see it in real life. Well, its better
  than B&amp;W.  A good map file to use is topo

  HAZE=nnn (0 - 100)
  Gives more realistic terrains by setting the amount of haze for distant
  objects when using full color in light source FILLTYPES. Works only in
  the "y" direction currently, so don't use it with much y rotation. Try
  "rotation=85/0/0". 0 disables.

  BACKGROUND=nn/nn/nn
  Sets the background color of the Targa-24 file by setting the red,
  green, and blue values (rr/gg/bb).

  LIGHTNAME=&lt;filename&gt;
  The name of the Targa-24 file to be created when using full color with
  light source. Default is light001.tga. If overwrite=no (the default),
  the file name will be incremented until an unused filename is found.
  Background in this file will be the color set by background=r/g/b, the
  default is sky blue.
