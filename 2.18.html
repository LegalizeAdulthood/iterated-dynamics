 2.18 Distance Estimator

  (distest=nnn/nnn)

  This used to be type=demm and type=demj.  These types have not died, but
  are only hiding!  They are equivalent to the mandel and julia types with
  the "distest=" option selected with a predetermined value.

  The Distance Estimator Method (p. 91) can be used to produce higher
  quality images of M and J sets, especially suitable for printing in
  black and white.

  If you have some *.fra files made with the old types demm/demj, you may
  want to convert them to the new form.  See the Mandelfn (p. 52) section
  for directions to carry out the conversion.
