 Appendix D Other Fractal Products

  (Forgive us, but we just *have* to begin this section with a plug for
  *our* fractal products even though the books are now out of print and
  hard to find ...)

  Several of Fractint's programmers have written books about fractals,
  Fractint, and Winfract (the Windows version of Fractint).  The book
  about Fractint is Fractal Creations Second Edition (1994 Waite Group
  Press, ISBN # 1-878739-34-4).  The book about Winfract is The Waite
  Group's Fractals for Windows (1992 Waite Group Press, ISBN # 1-878739-
  25-5).  These books are now very hard to find, so if you see one, better
  get it!
  Fractal Creations Second Edition includes:
   o A guided tour of Fractint.
   o A detailed manual and reference section of commands.
   o A tutorial on fractals.
   o A reference containing tips, explanations, and examples of parameters
     for all the Fractals generated by Fractint/Winfract.
   o Secrets on how the programs work internally.
   o Spectacular color plate section.
   o A CD containing Fractint and Xfract source and executable, and over a
     thousand spectacular fractal images.
   o A complete copy of the source code with a chapter explaining how the
     program works.

    Several Fractint enthusiasts are selling Fractal CDs.  One of the best
    are called "Fractal Dimensions" by Lee Skinner. Highly recommended
    original artwork in a variety of graphics formats.

    You can receive the "Fractal Dimensions CD" by sending $19.95US +
    $5.00 S&amp;H (or $10.00 S&amp;H outside USA) to

       Lee H. Skinner P. O. Box 14944 Albuquerque, NM  87191-4944 USA


  Michael Peters and Randall Scott have written a fractal program called
  HOP based on the Martin orbit fractals. This program is much narrower
  than Fractint in the kind of thing that it does, but has many more
  animation effects and makes a great screen saver. Michael sent us the
  algorithms for the chip, quadruptwo, and threeply fractal types to give
  us a taste. The file is called HOPZIP.EXE in LIB 9 of CompuServe's
  DIGART forum.

  Michael has also written a handy utility called PARTOBAT which creates a
  batch file for generating all the images in a Fractint PAR file.

  George Martin has written a useful formula file organizing program,
  distributed as ORGFRM.ZIP, which also includes a comprehensive
  collection of formulas. More than 15,000 formulas written by Fractint
  users are included in the compilation, arranged alphabetically by name,
  and with the original source file shown in each formula by comment,
  making the compilation an encyclopedia of formulas written for Fractint.
  The most recent version of ORGFRM.ZIP is available at the CompuServe
  site, and at Noel Giffin's web page described in the next paragraph. The
  package includes a utility program, orgform.exe, which copies the
