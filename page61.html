 2.27 Lorenz Attractors

  (type=lorenz/lorenz3d)

  The "Lorenz Attractor" is a "simple" set of three deterministic
  equations developed by Edward Lorenz while studying the non-
  repeatability of weather patterns.  The weather forecaster's basic
  problem is that even very tiny changes in initial patterns ("the beating
  of a butterfly's wings" - the official term is "sensitive dependence on
  initial conditions") eventually reduces the best weather forecast to
  rubble.

  The lorenz attractor is the plot of the orbit of a dynamic system
  consisting of three first order non-linear differential equations. The
  solution to the differential equation is vector-valued function of one
  variable.  If you think of the variable as time, the solution traces an
  orbit.  The orbit is made up of two spirals at an angle to each other in
  three dimensions. We change the orbit color as time goes on to add a
  little dazzle to the image.  The equations are:

                  dx/dt = -a*x + a*y
                  dy/dt =  b*x - y   -z*x
                  dz/dt = -c*z + x*y

  We solve these differential equations approximately using a method known
  as the first order taylor series.  Calculus teachers everywhere will
  kill us for saying this, but you treat the notation for the derivative
  dx/dt as though it really is a fraction, with "dx" the small change in x
  that happens when the time changes "dt".  So multiply through the above
  equations by dt, and you will have the change in the orbit for a small
  time step. We add these changes to the old vector to get the new vector
  after one step. This gives us:

               xnew = x + (-a*x*dt) + (a*y*dt)
               ynew = y + (b*x*dt) - (y*dt) - (z*x*dt)
               znew = z + (-c*z*dt) + (x*y*dt)

               (default values: dt = .02, a = 5, b = 15, c = 1)

  We connect the successive points with a line, project the resulting 3D
  orbit onto the screen, and voila! The Lorenz Attractor!

  We have added two versions of the Lorenz Attractor.  "Type=lorenz" is
  the Lorenz attractor as seen in everyday 2D.  "Type=lorenz3d" is the
  same set of equations with the added twist that the results are run
  through our perspective 3D routines, so that you get to view it from
  different angles (you can modify your perspective "on the fly" by using
  the &lt;I&gt; command.)  If you set the "stereo" option to "2", and have
  red/blue funny glasses on, you will see the attractor orbit with depth
  perception.

  Hint: the default perspective values (x = 60, y = 30, z = 0) aren't the
  best ones to use for fun Lorenz Attractor viewing.  Experiment a bit -
  start with rotation values of 0/0/0 and then change to 20/0/0 and 40/0/0
  to see the attractor from different angles.- and while you're at it, use
  a non-zero perspective point Try 100 and see what happens when you get
