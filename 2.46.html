 2.46 HyperComplex

  (type=hypercomplex,hypercomplexj)

  These fractals are based on hypercomplex numbers, which like quaternions
  are a four dimensional generalization of complex numbers. It is not
  possible to fully generalize the complex numbers to four dimensions
  without sacrificing some of the algebraic properties shared by real and
  complex numbers. Quaternions violate the commutative law of
  multiplication, which says z1*z2 = z2*z1. Hypercomplex numbers fail the
  rule that says all non-zero elements have multiplicative inverses - that
  is, if z is not 0, there should be a number 1/z such that (1/z)*(z) = 1.
  This law holds most of the time but not all the time for hypercomplex
  numbers.

  However hypercomplex numbers have a wonderful property for fractal
  purposes.  Every function defined for complex numbers has a simple
  generalization to hypercomplex numbers. Fractint's implementation takes
  advantage of this by using "fn" variables - the iteration formula is
      h(n+1) = fn(h(n)) + C.
  where "fn" is the hypercomplex generalization of sin, cos, log, sqr etc.
  You can see 3D versions of these fractals using fractal type Julibrot.
  Hypercomplex numbers were brought to our attention by Clyde Davenport,
  author of "A Hypercomplex Calculus with Applications to Relativity",
  ISBN 0-9623837-0-8.
