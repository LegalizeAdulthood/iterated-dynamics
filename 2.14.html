 2.14 Barnsley Mandelbrot/Julia Sets

  (type=barnsleym1/.../j3)

  Michael Barnsley has written a fascinating college-level text, "Fractals
  Everywhere," on fractal geometry and its graphic applications. (See
  Bibliography (p. 201).) In it, he applies the principle of the M and J
  sets to more general functions of two complex variables.

  We have incorporated three of Barnsley's examples in Fractint. Their
  appearance suggests polarized-light microphotographs of minerals, with
  patterns that are less organic and more crystalline than those of the
  M/J sets. Each example has both a "Mandelbrot" and a "Julia" type.
  Toggle between them using the spacebar.

  The parameters have the same meaning as they do for the "regular"
  Mandelbrot and Julia. For types M1, M2, and M3, they are used to "warp"
  the image by setting the initial value of Z. For the types J1 through
  J3, they are the values of C in the generating formulas.

  Be sure to try the &lt;O&gt;rbit function while plotting these types.
