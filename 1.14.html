 1.14 Browse Commands

  The following keystrokes function while browsing an image:

  &lt;ARROW KEYS&gt;     Step through the outlines on the screen.
  &lt;ENTER&gt;          Selects the image to display.
  &lt;\&gt;,&lt;h&gt;          Recalls the last image selected.
  &lt;D&gt;              Deletes the selected file.
  &lt;R&gt;              Renames the selected file.
  &lt;s&gt;              Saves the current image with the browser boxes
                   displayed.
  &lt;ESC&gt;,&lt;l&gt;        Toggles the browse mode off.
  &lt;Ctrl-b&gt;         Brings up the Browser Parameters (p. 149) screen.
  &lt;Ctrl-Ins/Del&gt;   Change the browser boxes color.

  This is a "visual directory", here is how it works...
  When 'L' or 'l' is pressed from a fractal display the current directory
  is searched for any saved files that are deeper zooms of the current
  image and their position shown on screen by a box (or crosshairs if the
  box would be too small). See also Browser Parameters (p. 149) for more
  on how this is done.

  One outline flashes, the selected outline can be changed by using the
  cursor keys.  At the moment the outlines are selected in the order that
  they appear in your directory, so don't worry if the flashing window
  jumps all over the place!

  When enter is pressed, the selected image is loaded. In this mode a
  stack of the last sixteen selected filenames is maintained and the '\'
  or 'h' key pops and loads the last image you were looking at.  Using
  this it is possible to set up sequences of images that allow easy
  exploration of your favorite fractal without having to wait for recalc
  once the level of zoom gets too high, great for demos! (also useful for
  keeping track of just exactly where fract532.gif came from :-) )

  You can also use this facility to tidy up your disk: by typing UPPER
  CASE 'D' when a file is selected the browser will delete the file for
  you, after making sure that you really mean it, you must reply to the
  "are you sure" prompts with an UPPER CASE 'Y' and nothing else,
  otherwise the command is ignored. Just to make absolutely sure you don't
  accidentally wipe out the fruits of many hours of cpu time the default
  setting is to have the browser prompt you twice, you can disable the
  second prompt within the parameters screen, however, if you're feeling
  overconfident :-).

  To complement the Delete function there is a rename function, use the
  UPPER CASE 'R' key for this. You need to enter the FULL new file name,
  no .GIF is implied.

  It is possible to save the current image along with all of the displayed
  boxes indicating subimages by pressing the 's' key.  This exits the
  browse mode to save the image and the boxes become a permanent part of
  the image.  Currently, the screen image ends up with stray dots colored
  after it is saved.

  Esc backs out of image selecting mode.

  The browser can now use expanded memory or extended memory.  If you have
  more than 4 MB of expanded/extended memory available, you can use
  either.  If you don't have 4 MB of expanded/extended memory available,
  use expanded memory as it will allocate as much as possible.  The
  extended memory support will silently fail and default to the use of far
  memory if 4 MB of extended memory is not available.

  Here's a tip on how to zoom out beyond your starting point when
  browsing: Suppose you restore a fractal deeply-zoomed down in a
  directory of related zoomed images, and then bring up the browser.  How
  do you zoom out? You can't use "\" because you started with the zoomed
  image, and there is no browser command to detect the next outer image.
  What you can do is exit the browser, press PgUp until the zoom box won't
  get any smaller, zoom out with Ctrl-Enter, and before any image starts
  to develop, call up the browser again, locate your zoomed image that you
  started with, and see if there is another image that contains it - if
  so, restore it with the browser.  You can also use a view window &lt;v&gt; to
  load the first image, and then use the browser.

  POSSIBLE ERRORS:

  "Sorry..I can't find anything"
  The browser can't locate any files which match the file name mask.  See
  Browser Parameters (p. 149)  This is also displayed if you have less
  than 10K of far memory free when you run Fractint.

  "Sorry....  no more space"
  At the moment the browser can only cope with 450 sub images at one time.
  Any subsequent images are ignored.  Make sure that the minimum image
  size isn't set too small on the parameters screen.

  "Sorry .... out of memory"
  The browser has run out of far, expanded, or extended memory in which to
  store the pixels covered by the sub image boxes.  Try again with the
  main image at lower resolution, and/or reduce the number of TSRs
  resident in memory when you start Fractint.  Make sure you have expanded
  or extended memory available.

  "Sorry...it's a read only file, can't del &lt;filename&gt;"
  "Sorry....can't rename"
  The file which you were trying to delete or rename has the read only
  attribute set, you'll need to reset this with your operating system
  before you can get rid of it.
