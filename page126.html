 5.7 Fractal Type Parameters

  TYPE=[name]
  Selects the fractal type to calculate. The default is type "mandel".

  PARAMS=n/n/n/n...
  Set optional (required, for some fractal types) values used in the
  calculations. These numbers typically represent the real and imaginary
  portions of some startup value, and are described in detail as needed in
  Fractal Types (p. 43).
  (Example: FRACTINT TYPE=julia PARAMS=-0.48/0.626 would wait at the
  opening screen for you to select a video mode, but then proceed straight
  to the Julia set for the stated x (real) and y (imaginary) coordinates.)

  FUNCTION=[fn1[/fn2[/fn3[/fn4]]]]
  Allows setting variable functions found in some fractal type formulae.
  Possible values are sin, cos, tan, cotan, sinh, cosh, tanh, cotanh, exp,
  log, sqr, recip (i.e. 1/z), ident (i.e. identity), cosxx (cos with a pre
  version 16 bug), flip, zero, one, asin, asinh, acos, acosh, atan, atanh,
  sqrt, abs (abs(x)+i*abs(y)), cabs (sqrt(x*x+y*y)). New additions are the
  various rounding-to-integer functions: floor (round down), ceil (round
  up), trunc (round toward zero), and round (round to nearest).

  FORMULANAME=[formulaname]
  Specifies the default formula name for type=formula fractals.  (I.e. the
  name of a formula defined in the FORMULAFILE.) Required if you want to
  generate one of these fractal types in batch mode, as this is the only
  way to specify a formula name in that case.

  LNAME=[lsystemname]
  Specifies the default L-System name. (I.e. the name of an entry in the
  LFILE.) Required if you want to generate one of these fractal types in
  batch mode, as this is the only way to specify an L-System name in that
  case.

  IFS=[ifsname]
  Specifies the default IFS name. (I.e. the name of an entry in the
  IFSFILE.) Required if you want to generate one of these fractal types in
  batch mode, as this is the only way to specify an IFS name in that case.


 5.8 Image Calculation Parameters

  MAXITER=nnn
  Reset the iteration maximum (the number of iterations at which the
  program gives up and says 'OK, this point seems to be part of the set in
  question and should be colored [insidecolor]') from the default 150.
  Values range from 2 to 2,147,483,647 (super-high iteration limits like
  200000000 are useful when using logarithmic palettes).  See The
  Mandelbrot Set (p. 43) for a description of the iteration method of
  calculating fractals.
  "maxiter=" can also be used to adjust the number of orbits plotted for
  3D "attractor" fractal types such as lorenz3d and kamtorus.
