 2.34 Test

  (type=test)

  This is a stub that we (and you!) use for trying out new fractal types.
  "Type=test" fractals make use of Fractint's structure and features for
  whatever code is in the routine 'testpt()' (located in the small source
  file TESTPT.C) to determine the color of a particular pixel.

  If you have a favorite fractal type that you believe would fit nicely
  into Fractint, just rewrite the C function in TESTPT.C (or use the
  prototype function there, which is a simple M-set implementation) with
  an algorithm that computes a color based on a point in the complex
  plane.

  After you get it working, send your code to one of the authors and we
  might just add it to the next release of Fractint, with full credit to
  you. Our criteria are: 1) an interesting image and 2) a formula
  significantly different from types already supported. (Bribery may also
  work. THIS author is completely honest, but I don't trust those other
  guys.) Be sure to include an explanation of your algorithm and the
  parameters supported, preferably formatted as you see here to simplify
  folding it into the documentation.
