 5.23 Image Coordinates Screen

  You can directly enter corner coordinates on this screen instead of
  using the zoom box to move around.  You can also use &lt;F4&gt; to reset the
  coordinates to the defaults for the current fractal type.

  There are two formats for the display: corners or center-mag.  You can
  toggle between the two by using &lt;F7&gt;.

  In corners mode, corner coordinate values are entered directly.  Usually
  only the top-left and bottom-right corners need be specified - the
  bottom left corner can be entered as zeros to default to an ordinary
  unrotated rectangular area.  For rotated or skewed images, the bottom
  left corner must also be specified.

  In center-mag mode the image area is described by entering the
  coordinates for the center of the rectangle, and its magnification
  factor.  Usually only these three values are needed, but the user can
  also specify the amount that the image is stretched, rotated and skewed.
