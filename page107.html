  Preview Mode: Preview mode provides a rapid look at your transformed
     image using by skipping a lot of rows and filling the image in. Good
     for quickly discovering the best parameters. Let's face it, the
     Fractint authors most famous for "blazingly fast" code *DIDN'T* write
     the 3D routines!  [Pieter: "But they *are* picking away it and making
     some progress in each release."]

  Show Box: If you have selected Preview Mode you have another option to
     worry about. This is the option to show the image box in scaled and
     rotated coordinates x, y, and z. The box only appears in rectangular
     transformations and shows how the final image will be oriented. If
     you select light source in the next screen, it will also show you the
     light source vector so you can tell where the light is coming from in
     relation to your image. Sorry no head or tail on the vector yet.

  Coarseness: This sets how many divisions the image will be divided into
     in the y direction, if you select preview mode, ray tracing output,
     or grid fill in the "Select Fill Type" screen.

  Spherical Projection: The next question asks if you want a sphere
     projection. This will take your image and map it onto a plane if you
     answer "no" or a sphere if you answer "yes" as described above. Try
     it and you'll see what we mean.  See Spherical Projection (p. 114).

  Stereo:

     Stereo sound in Fractint? Well, not yet. Fractint now allows you to
     create 3D images for use with red/blue glasses like 3D comics you may
     have seen, or images like Captain EO.

     Option 0 is normal old 3D you can look at with just your eyes.

     Options 1 and 2 require the special red/blue-green glasses.  They are
     meant to be viewed right on the screen or on a color print off of the
     screen. The image can be made to hover entirely or partially in front
     of the screen. Great fun!  These two options give a gray scale image
     when viewed.

     Option 1 gives 64 shades of gray but with half the spatial resolution
     you have selected. It works by writing the red and blue images on
     adjacent pixels, which is why it eats half your resolution. In
     general, we recommend you use this only with resolutions above
     640x350. Use this mode for continuous potential landscapes where you
     *NEED* all those shades.

     Option "2" gives you full spatial resolution but with only 16 shades
     of gray. If the red and blue images overlap, the colors are mixed.
     Good for wire-frame images (we call them surface grids), lorenz3d and
     3D IFS. Works fine in 16 color modes.

     Option 3 is for creating stereo pair images for view later with more
     specialized equipment. It allows full color images to be presented in
     glorious stereo. The left image presented on the screen first. You
     may photograph it or save it. Then the second image is presented, you
     may do the same as the first image. You can then take the two images
     and convert them to a stereo image pair as outlined by Bruce Goren
