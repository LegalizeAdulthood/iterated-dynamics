 2.28 Rossler Attractors

  (type=rossler3D)

  This fractal is named after the German Otto Rossler, a non-practicing
  medical doctor who approached chaos with a bemusedly philosophical
  attitude.  He would see strange attractors as philosophical objects. His
  fractal namesake looks like a band of ribbon with a fold in it. All we
  can say is we used the same calculus-teacher-defeating trick of
  multiplying the equations by "dt" to solve the differential equation and
  generate the orbit.  This time we will skip straight to the orbit
  generator - if you followed what we did above with type Lorenz (p. 61)
  you can easily reverse engineer the differential equations.

               xnew = x - y*dt -   z*dt
               ynew = y + x*dt + a*y*dt
               znew = z + b*dt + x*z*dt - c*z*dt

  Default parameters are dt = .04, a = .2, b = .2, c = 5.7
