 1.10 Interrupting and Resuming

  Fractint command keys can be loosely grouped as:

   o Keys which suspend calculation of the current image (if one is being
     calculated) and automatically resume after the function.  &lt;Tab&gt;
     (display status information) and &lt;F1&gt; (display help), are the only
     keys in this group.

   o Keys which automatically trigger calculation of a new image.
     Examples:  selecting a video mode (e.g. &lt;F3&gt;);  selecting a fractal
     type using &lt;T&gt;;  using the &lt;X&gt; screen to change an option such as
     maximum iterations.

   o Keys which do something, then wait for you to indicate what to do
     next.  Examples:  &lt;M&gt; to go to main menu;  &lt;C&gt; to enter color cycling
     mode;  &lt;PageUp&gt; to bring up a zoom box.  After using a command in
     this group, calculation automatically resumes when you return from
     the function (e.g. &lt;Esc&gt; from color cycling, &lt;PageDn&gt; to clear zoom
     box).  There are a few fractal types which cannot resume calculation,
     they are noted below.  Note that after saving an image with &lt;S&gt;, you
     must press &lt;Enter&gt; to clear the "saved" message from the screen and
     resume.

  An image which is &lt;S&gt;aved before it completes can later be &lt;R&gt;estored
  and continued. The calculation is automatically resumed when you restore
  such an image.

  When a slow fractal type resumes after an interruption in the third
  category above, there may be a lag while nothing visible happens.  This
  is because most cases of resume restart at the beginning of a screen
  line.  If unsure, you can check whether calculation has resumed with the
  &lt;Tab&gt; key.

  The following fractal types cannot (currently) be resumed: plasma, 3d
  transformations, julibrot, and 3d orbital types like lorenz3d.  To check
  whether resuming an image is possible, use the &lt;Tab&gt; key while it is
  calculating.  It is resumable unless there is a note under the fractal
  type saying it is not.

  The Batch Mode (p. 148) section discusses how to resume in batch mode.

  To &lt;R&gt;estore and resume a "formula", "lsystem", or "ifs" type fractal
  your "formulafile", "lfile", or "ifsfile" must contain the required
  name.
