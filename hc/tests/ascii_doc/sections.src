~Topic=New Features in 1.0
Iterated Dynamics is a fork of the DOS program Fractint.  Fractint has
its own history spanning many years.  Please consult the Fractint help
for its history.  To avoid being confused with a new release of Fractint,
the code has been rebranded Iterated Dynamics, or Id for short, throughout.
;
;
;
~Topic=Introduction
Iterated Dynamics, or Id for short, plots and manipulates images of
"objects" -- actually, sets of mathematical points -- that have fractal
dimension.  For now, these sets of points have three
important properties:
;
;
;
~Topic=Conditions on Use

Iterated Dynamics is open source software.  The copyright is retained by
the primary author, Richard Thomson.  Legacy code is copyright the
Stone Soup Group.
;
;
;
~Topic=Getting Started

To start the program, locate the Id executable in the installation
directory.  The program displays an initial "credits" screen.
;
;
;
~Topic=Fractal Types

A list of the fractal types and their mathematics can be found in the
Summary of Fractal Types.  Some notes about how Id calculates them
are in "A Little Code".

~Topic=The Mandelbrot Set, Label=HT_MANDEL
(type=mandel)

This set is the classic: the only one implemented in many plotting
programs, and the source of most of the printed fractal images published.
Like most of the other types in Id, it is simply a
graph: the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) coordinate axes represent
ranges of two independent quantities, with various colors used to
symbolize levels of a third quantity which depends on the first two.  So
far, so good: basic analytic geometry.

~Topic=Drawing Method

The "passes option" (<X> options screen or "passes=" parameter)
selects one of the single-pass, dual-pass, triple-pass, solid-guessing
(default), solid-guessing after pass n, boundary tracing, tesseral,
synchronous orbits, or orbits modes.

~Topic=3D Mode Selection, Label=HELP_3D_MODE

After hitting <3> and getting past the filename prompt and video mode
selection, you're presented with a "3D Mode Selection" screen.  If you
wish to change the default for any of the following parameters,
use the arrow keys to move through the menu.  When you're
satisfied press <Enter>.
;
;
;
~Topic=Using the Command Line

You can specify parameters when you start Id by using a command like:

id sound=off filename=myimage.gif

The individual parameters are separated by one or more spaces (an
parameter itself may not include spaces).  Upper or lower case may be
used, and parameters can be in any order.
;
;
;
~Topic="Disk-Video" Modes

These "video modes" do not involve a graphic display at all.  They use
memory or your disk drive (as file id.$$$) to store the fractal image.
These modes are useful for creating images beyond the size of your
screen, right up to the current internal limit of 32767 x 32767 x 256,
e.g. for subsequent printing.  They're also useful for background
processing - create an image in a disk-video mode, save it, then
restore it in a real video mode.
;
;
;
~Topic=Common Problems

Here are some common problems and their possible solutions:

If Id hangs on startup, it may have difficulty loading the video
mode table in id.cfg.  Without a video mode, Id doesn't have any
sort of driver to interact with the screen and therefore can't
display any sort of error message.  Try starting Id from the
directory containing this file.

~Topic=Before Mandelbrot

Like new forms of life, new branches of mathematics and science don't
appear from nowhere.  The ideas of fractal geometry can be traced to the
late nineteenth century, when mathematicians created shapes -- sets of
points -- that seemed to have no counterpart in nature.  By a wonderful
irony, the "abstract" mathematics descended from that work has now turned
out to be more appropriate than any other for describing many natural
shapes and processes.

SUMMARY OF FRACTAL TYPES

ant

Generalized Ant Automaton as described in the July 1994 Scientific
American.  Some ants wander around the screen.  A rule string (the first
parameter) determines the ant's direction.  When the type 1 ant leaves a
cell of color k, it turns right if the kth symbol in the first parameter
is a 1, or left otherwise.  Then the color in the old cell is incremented.
The 2nd parameter is a maximum iteration to guarantee that the fractal
will terminate.  The 3rd parameter is the number of ants.  The 4th is the
ant type 1 or 2.  The 5th parameter determines if the ants wrap the screen
or stop at the edge.  The 6th parameter is a random seed.  You can slow
down the ants to see them better using the <P> screen Orbit Delay.

THE STONE SOUP STORY

Once upon a time, somewhere in Eastern Europe, there was a great famine.
People jealously hoarded whatever food they could find, hiding it even
from their friends and neighbors.  One day a peddler drove his wagon into a
village, sold a few of his wares, and began asking questions as if he
planned to stay for the night.
