== Bullet Demonstration

=== Bullets

This is a paragraph before.

* This is a single line bullet.
* This is another bullet, across multiple source lines.  It goes on for
  long enough that it will consume multiple output lines when formatted
  as a printed document.
* This is another single line bullet.

This is a paragraph after.

Now we have some indented bullets.

  * This is the first indented bullet.
  * This is the second indented bullet.  It goes on for long enough that
    it will consume multiple output lines when formatted as a printed
    document.
  * This is another single line bullet.

This is another paragraph after.
