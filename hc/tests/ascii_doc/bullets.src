This is a paragraph before.

o This is a single line bullet.\
o This is another bullet, across multiple source
  lines.  It goes on for long enough that it will consume
  multiple output lines when formatted as a printed document.
o This is another single line bullet.\

This is a paragraph after.

Now we have some indented bullets.

  o This is the first indented bullet.\
  o This is the second indented bullet.  It goes on for long
    enough that it will consume multiple output lines when
    formatted as a printed document.
  o This is another single line bullet.\

This is another paragraph after.
