 3. Bullet Demonstration


 3.1 Bullets

  This is a paragraph before.

  o This is a single line bullet.
  o This is another bullet, across multiple source lines.  It goes on for
    long enough that it will consume multiple output lines when formatted
    as a printed document.
  o This is another single line bullet.

  This is a paragraph after.

  Now we have some indented bullets.

    o This is the first indented bullet.
    o This is the second indented bullet.  It goes on for long enough that
      it will consume multiple output lines when formatted as a printed
      document.
    o This is another single line bullet.

  This is another paragraph after.
