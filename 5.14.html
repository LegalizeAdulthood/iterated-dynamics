 5.14 Printer Parameters

  PRINTER=type[/resolution[/port#]]
  Defines your printer setup. The SSTOOLS.INI file is a REAL handy place
  to put this option, so that it's available whenever you have that
  sudden, irresistible urge for hard copy.
  Printer types:
    IB  IBM-compatible (default)
    EP  Epson-compatible
    HP  LaserJet
    CO  Star Micronics Color printer, supposedly Epson-color-compatible
    PA  Paintjet
    PS  PostScript
    PSL Postscript, landscape mode
    PL  Plotter using HP-GL
  Resolution:
    In dots per inch.
    Epson/IBM: 60, 120, 240
    LaserJet: 75, 150, 300
    PaintJet: 90, 180
    PostScript: 10 through 600, or special value 0 to print full page to
    within about .4" of the edges (in portrait mode, width is full page and
    height is adjusted to 3:4 aspect ratio)
    Plotter: 1 to 10 for 1/Nth of page (e.g. 2 for 1/2 page)
  Port:
    1, 2, 3 for LPT1-3 via BIOS
    11, 12, 13, 14 for COM1-4 via BIOS
    21, 22 for LPT1 or LPT2 using direct port access (faster when it works)
    31, 32 for COM1 or COM2 using direct port access

  COMPORT=port/baud/options
  Serial printer port initialization.
  Port=1,2,3,etc.
  Baud=115,150,300,600,1200,2400,4800,9600
  Options: 7,8 | 1,2 | e,n,o (any order).
  Example: comport=1/9600/n81 for COM1 set to 9600, no parity, 8 bits per
  character, 1 stop bit.

  LINEFEED=crlf|lf|cr
  Specifies the control characters to emit at end of each line:  carriage
  return and linefeed, just linefeed, or just carriage return.  The
  default is crlf.

  TITLE=yes
  If specified, title information is added to printouts.

  PRINTFILE=[&lt;path&gt;\]filename
  Causes output data for the printer to be written to the named file on
  disk instead of to a printer port. The filename is incremented by 1 each
  time an image is printed - e.g. if the name is FRAC01.PRN, the second
  print operation writes to FRAC02.PRN, etc. Existing files are not
  overwritten - if the file exists, the filename is incremented to a new
  name.
