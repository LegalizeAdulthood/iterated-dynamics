What if you want to run the same fitnesse fixture, 5 times and want to make sure that each time it runs it does not take more than 75 milliseconds? Also you want to make sure overall, it does not take more than 100 milliseconds.

!|Max Time|100|milliseconds|
|Loop|5|times|
|Max Time|75|milliseconds|
|Division|
|numerator|denominator|quotient()|
|10|2|5|
|12.6|3|4.2|
|100|4|25|

'''Note:''' Again you can see here, how you can pipe different decorators and create powerful decorator patterns.
