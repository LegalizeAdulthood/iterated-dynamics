The TestRunner must be debuggable.

Here is a general outline of a TestRunner execution:
 0 TestRunner is started
 0 TestRunner initiates a FitServer session
 0 FitServer sends a request specifying which test to run to a FitNesse server
 0 FitNesse responds by sending all the test data
 0 FitServer accepts the test data and executes the test.
 0 TestRunner accepts the test results from FitServer as they are completed
 0 TestRunner generates reports and output.
