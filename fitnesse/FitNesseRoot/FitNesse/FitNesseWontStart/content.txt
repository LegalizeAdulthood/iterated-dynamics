!2 What to Do if Port 80 Is Already In Use
If you see the message:

''!-FitNesse-! cannot be started...''

Then port 80 is already in use by another web server running on your machine (e.g., perhaps by Microsoft's IIS server). In this case, do the following:
!3 Windows
  * Edit the '''run.bat''' command to look like this (using port 8080):
   * java -cp fitnesse.jar fitnesse.FitNesse -p 8080 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5
  * Save '''run.bat'''
  * Double-click '''run.bat''' again.
  * Return to DownloadingAndInstallingFitNesse.

!3 Linux, Unix, Mac OS X
  * Edit the '''run.sh''' command to look like this (using port 8080):
   * java ${jvm_args[*]} fitnesse.FitNesse -p 8080 ${fitnesse_args[*]}
  * Or, just invoke '''run.sh''' with the "-p port_number" argument from the command line.
  * Return to DownloadingAndInstallingFitNesse.

!2 What to Do If You Have the Wrong Java Runtime Environment
FitNesse requires version 1.5 or later of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). 
If you see the messages: 

''!-C:\fitnesse>java -cp fitnesse.jar fitnesse.FitNesse-!
!-Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:-!
!-java/lang/CharSequence-!
!-       at fitnesse.FitNesse.parseCommandLine(Unknown Source)-!
!-        at fitnesse.FitNesse.main(Unknown Source)-!

!-C:\fitnesse>pause-!
!-Press any key to continue . . .-!''

Then you need to download and install version 1.5 or later of the JRE. Follow these steps:
 * Press a key to close the command window
 * Go to [[this download link][https://jsecom15a.sun.com:443/ECom/EComActionServlet;jsessionid=jsecom15a.sun.com-9752%3A415dafbe%3A147685f2fbcc1de1]].
 * Accept the terms of agreement (if you are permitted), and click Continue.
 * Download the right JRE installer for your machine and operating system.
 * Launch the installer, and follow its instructions to install JRE 1.5 or later.
 * Change the PATH environment variable so that it points to the new JRE.
   * Go to the /bin folder that contains java.exe, and copy the pathname (for example, ''C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.5.0_13'')
   * Go to Settings>Control Panel>System>Advanced>Environment Variables>PATH>Edit
   * Paste in that same complete pathname 
   * Save the PATH environment variable, and close the System control panel
 * Double-click run.bat again.
 * Return to DownloadingAndInstallingFitNesse.
