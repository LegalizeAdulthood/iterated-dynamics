Sometimes you want to show a !-WikiWord-! without having it turn into a link.  Or sometimes you might want to show some wiki markup text such as !-'''bold'''-! without having the markup take effect.  To do this you use the ''literal'' markup text.

Any text enclosed in '''!-!--!''' and '''-!''' will be treated as a literal and will not be processed for wiki words or other markup widgets.

|!c '''Markup Text'''|!c '''Displays as'''|
|!-!-WikiWord-!-!|!-WikiWord-!|
|!-!-'''bold'''-!-!|!-'''bold'''-!|
