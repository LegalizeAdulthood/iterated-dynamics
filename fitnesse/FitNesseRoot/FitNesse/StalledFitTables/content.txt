There is a nasty bug in Fit that causes Fit to stall, or fail silently without output.  You can see this bug by clicking on the run button below.

|eg.division|
|numerator|denominator|quotient()|
|5|1|5|

This bug is caused by a subtle mispelling of the fixture name.  The name of the fixtures should be '''eg.Division'''.  Apparently when you use the wrong case in a fixture name, Fit stalls.
