!2 Downloading and Installing FitNesse
It really takes very little time and effort to get FitNesse running on your machine. 
 1 Go to http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.DownLoad and click on "'''Full Distribution'''". Save the fitnesse.zip to some directory.  Let's call that directory ''root''.
 2 Unzip fitnesse.zip.
  * This should create a ''fitnesse'' directory below ''root'' with the following files and folders:
  * !-FitNesseRoot-!, README.txt, dotnet, license.txt, fitnesse.jar, run.bat, run.sh
 3 Now go to the ''root''/fitnesse folder and double-click run.bat
  * If you have nothing running on port 80 on your machine, you should see a message similar to the following:
   * Fitnesse (''date code'') Started...
    * on port      80
    * using path   '.'
    * using dir    '!-FitNesseRoot-!'
    * Not logging.
  * If you don't see this, check out FitNesseWontStart.
 4 Start up a browser and go to http://localhost
  * ''or if you had to edit run.bat in step 3 then go to http://localhost:8080.''
 5 The main FitNesse screen should come up. That's it. You're ready to start using FitNesse.
