!3 A step by step procedure for getting started with FitNesse

 1 Download fitnesse.zip and put it into some directory.  Let's call that directory ''root''.
 2 Unzip fitnesse.zip.
  * This should create a ''fitnesse'' directory below ''root'' with the following files.
  * !-FitNesseRoot-!, README.txt, dotnet, fitnesse.jar, run.bat, run.sh
 3 Now go to the ''root''/fitnesse folder and double-click run.bat
  * You should see the following message:
   * Fitnesse (''date code'') Started...
    * on port      80
    * using path   '.'
    * using dir    '!-FitNesseRoot-!'
    * Not logging.
  * If you don't see this, then click [[here][^FitNesseWontStart]].
 4 Start up a browser and go to http://localhost
  * ''or if you had to edit run.bat in step 3 then go to http://localhost:8080.''
 5 The main FitNesse screen should come up.
