!3 If you want a string value to include leading or trailing whitespace, use the syntax for escaping literals:

precede it with !-!--!
follow it with !--!-!

for example, " value" would be represented as !-!--! value!--!-!

|string|
|field|field?||
|value|!-value-!|"value"|
|!- value-!|!- value-!|" value"|
|!- value-!|fail[value]|" value" fails against "value"|
