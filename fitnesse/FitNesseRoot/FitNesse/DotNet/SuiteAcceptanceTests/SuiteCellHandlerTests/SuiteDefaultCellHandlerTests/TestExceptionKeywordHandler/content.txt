!3 In addition to the "error" keyword, you can use the "exception" keyword to specify that an exception with a specific message and/or of a specific class is thrown.

Works with just messages
!|exception throwing fixture|
|message|throw null reference exception!|throw application exception!|
|this is the message|exception["this is the message"]|exception["this is the message"]|

.. or just the class name
!|exception throwing fixture|
|message|throw null reference exception!|throw application exception!|
|this is the message|exception[NullReferenceException]|exception[ApplicationException]|

.. or both!
!|exception throwing fixture|
|message|throw null reference exception!|throw application exception!|
|this is the message|exception[NullReferenceException: "this is the message"]|exception[ApplicationException: "this is the message"]|
