ArrayFixture tables look almost the same as !-RowFixture-! tables. However, the order of the elements in the list has to be the same as the order of the rows in an ArrayFixture table.
 * This passes:
|!-StartListing-!|
|list is|1,2,3,4|

|''ordered list''|
|''item''|
|1|
|2|
|3|
|4|
 * But this fails:
|''ordered list''|
|''item''|
|3|
|4|
|1|
|2|
 * Compare this to using a !-RowFixture-!, where the order doesn't matter:
|''row list''|
|''item''|
|3|
|4|
|1|
|2|
Let's look at WritingListFixtures for ''!-ArrayFixture-!''s (and others).

The header labels of ArrayFixture tables can contain any characters, such as "$".
