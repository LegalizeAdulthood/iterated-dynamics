!3 Actions and Methods
Each action in a ''!-DoFixture-!'' table is mapped directly to a method in the fixture (we'll expand this model in FixtureDetails).

Eg, consider the first few tables:
 * The fixture of the first table is a ''!-DoFixture-!'', so the created ''flow fixture object'' handles the rest of the tables:
| !-ChatStart-! |
 * The second table contains an action, which is mapped into the method ''connectUser()'' of the (initial) ''flow fixture object'', as shown below. 
|''connect user''|sarah|
 * The third table contains two actions which are also applied to the ''flow fixture object''.
|''user''|sarah|''creates''|fit|''room''|
|''user''|sarah|''enters''|fit|''room''|

!3 Some Example Code
----{{{public class ChatStart extends fitlibrary.DoFixture {
	private ChatRoom chat = new ChatRoom();
	
	public ChatStart() {
	    setSystemUnderTest(chat);
	}
	public boolean connectUser(String userName) {
		return chat.connectUser(userName);
	}
	public boolean userCreatesRoom(String userName, String roomName) {
		return chat.userCreatesRoom(userName,roomName);
	}
	public boolean userEntersRoom(String userName, String roomName) {
		return chat.userEntersRoom(userName,roomName);
	}
	...
}}}----
The next table checks a list.

|''users in room''|fit|
|''name''|
|sarah|

The first row is an action, which corresponds to the method ''usersInRoom()'' which returns a [[''!-ParamRowFixture-!''][.FitLibraryUserGuide.ParamRowFixture]]. This fixture object interprets the rest of the table.
----{{{	...
	public Fixture usersInRoom(String roomName) {
		return new ParamRowFixture(chat.usersInRoom(roomName).toArray(),User.class);
	}
	...
}}}----
Each following table is handled by the initial ''!-DoFixture-!'':

|''connect user''|rick|

This means that each table doesn't need an explicit fixture, so actions can be split up easily. Because actions may return a fixture object for the rest of the table, that object can be created with all the appropriate information. This avoids the needs for global variables for communication between fixtures.
