Let's look at what happens when an action fails.

| !-ChatStart-! |

|''connect user''|sarah|

|''user''|sarah|''creates''|fit|''room''|

There should be no occupants in the "fitNesse" room:

|check|''occupants''|fit|0|

Sarah can't enter an unknown room:

|''user''|sarah|''enters''|unfit|''room''|

We can expect that, by putting ''reject'' in the first cell:

|reject|''user''|sarah|''enters''|unfit|''room''|

and an unknown user can't create a room:

|reject|''user''|george|''creates''|unfit|''room''|

Sarah hasn't entered the room, so she can't be in there:

|''users in room''|fit|
|''name''|
|sarah|
