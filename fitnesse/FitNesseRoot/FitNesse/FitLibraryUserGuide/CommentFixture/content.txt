The contents of a CommentFixture table are not considered:

!|fitlibrary.CommentFixture|
|any old|stuff|
|is|completely|ignored|
|and|not even|coloured as|ignored|

This is also supported directly in flow.

If we want the table to be ignored and that to be reported, we can instead use:

!|fit.Fixture|
|any old|stuff|
|is|ignored|
|but|it's|coloured as|ignored|
