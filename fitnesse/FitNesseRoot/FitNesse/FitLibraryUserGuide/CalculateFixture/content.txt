CalculateFixture is for testing calculations, like ''!-ColumnFixture-!''. CalculateFixture was introduced to explore a few ideas.
 * It's minimalistic, in the sense that there are no (default) special values, such as " " and "error", as used in ''!-ColumnFixture-!''. Such special values can be explicitly defined in the fixture code.
 * It distinguishes between the ''given'' values and the ''expected'' values by using a blank column to separate the ''givens'' on the left side and the ''expecteds'' on the right.
 * It allows any characters in the second (header) row, including unicode.
 * It can simplify ^WritingFixtures in some cases.
