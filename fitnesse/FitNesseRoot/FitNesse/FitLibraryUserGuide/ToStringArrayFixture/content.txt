ToStringArrayFixture was developed by Jeff Nielsen.

ToStringArrayFixture is similar to ''!-ArrayFixture-!'' except that:
 * There is no header row (the second row)
 * There is a single column, containing the ''toString()'' value of the elements
 * The elements of the collection (List, array, etc) are compared aginst the values in the table by using the result of their ''toString()'' methods
Eg:

!|fitlibrary.specify.ToStringArrayFixtureUnderTest|
|one|
|two|
|three|
