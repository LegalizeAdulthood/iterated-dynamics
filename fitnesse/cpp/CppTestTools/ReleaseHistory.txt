 - Added make depend support for GCC
 - Improved release process support
 - Enabled some commented out tests in ActiveObjectTest

   so the programmer puts IMPORT_TEST_GROUP in the right place

CppFit Changes
 - Multiple cell evaluation eliminated
 - MS version: DLL only opened one time for fixture loading
 

 - Changed UnitTestHarness 
   - assertion macros can be called like funcitons
     May require adding semicolons to some statements
   - Added unit tests
   - Design changes for testability
   - Got rid of the memory leak tolerate experimental stuff
   - More accurate memory leak messages
   - Leaks gone for gcc 3.3.4 and vs.net
   - vc6 still reports some phantom leaks
   - Assert macros can be factored out of TEST body into helper functions

 - Added per test memory leak detection
 - There are some leaking Fit tests under VC++6.  The memory is released when 
   the system exits.  The leaks appear to be lazy initialized staics that 
   get cleaned up at program exit but report as a leak in a particular test.
 - VC++6 and VS.NET workspaces and solutions supported

CppTestTools20040524.zip
 - FitLib - fixed spaces in strings bug


CppTestTools20040524.zip - initial release
