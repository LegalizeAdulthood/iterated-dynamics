 4. "3D" Images

  Fractint can restore images in "3D". Important: we use quotation marks
  because it does not CREATE images of 3D fractal objects (there are such,
  but we're not there yet.) Instead, it restores .GIF images as a 3D
  PROJECTION or STEREO IMAGE PAIR.  The iteration values you've come to
  know and love, the ones that determine pixel colors, are translated into
  "height" so that your saved screen becomes a landscape viewed in
  perspective. You can even wrap the landscape onto a sphere for
  realistic-looking planets and moons that never existed outside your PC!

  We suggest starting with a saved plasma-cloud screen. Hit &lt;3&gt; in main
  command mode to begin the process. Next, select the file to be
  transformed, and the video mode. (Usually you want the same video mode
  the file was generated in; other choices may or may not work.)

  After hitting &lt;3&gt;, you'll be bombarded with a long series of options.
  Not to worry: all of them have defaults chosen to yield an acceptable
  starting image, so the first time out just pump your way through with
  the &lt;Enter&gt; key. When you enter a different value for any option, that
  becomes the default value the next time you hit &lt;3&gt;, so you can change
  one option at a time until you get what you want. Generally &lt;ESC&gt; will
  take you back to the previous screen.

  Once you're familiar with the effects of the 3D option values you have a
  variety of options on how to specify them. You can specify them all on
  the command line (there ARE a lot of them so they may not all fit within
  the DOS command line limits), with an SSTOOLS.INI file, or with a
  parameter file.

  Here's an example for you power FRACTINTers, the command

        FRACTINT MYFILE SAVENAME=MY3D 3D=YES BATCH=YES

  would make Fractint load MYFILE.GIF, re-plot it as a 3D landscape
  (taking all of the defaults), save the result as MY3D.GIF, and exit to
  DOS. By the time you've come back with that cup of coffee, you'll have a
  new world to view, if not conquer.

  Note that the image created by 3D transformation is treated as if it
  were a plasma cloud - We have NO idea how to retain the ability to zoom
  and pan around a 3D image that has been twisted, stretched, perspective-
  ized, and water-leveled. Actually, we do, but it involves the kind of
  hardware that Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Pixar et al. use for feature
  films. So if you'd like to send us a check equivalent to George Lucas'
  net from the "Star Wars" series...


 4.1 3D Mode Selection

  After hitting &lt;3&gt; and getting past the filename prompt and video mode
  selection, you're presented with a "3d Mode Selection" screen.  If you
  wish to change the default for any of the following parameters, use the
  cursor keys to move through the menu. When you're satisfied press
  &lt;Enter&gt;.
