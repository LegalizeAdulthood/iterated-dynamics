 1.8 Parameter Save/Restore Commands

  Parameter files can be used to save/restore all options and settings
  required to recreate particular images.  The parameters required to
  describe an image require very little disk space, especially compared
  with saving the image itself.

  &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;

  The &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt; command loads a set of parameters describing an image.
  (Actually, it can also be used to set non-image parameters such as
  SOUND, but at this point we're interested in images. Other uses of
  parameter files are discussed in "Parameter Files and the &lt;@&gt; Command"
  (p. 121).)

  When you hit &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;, Fractint displays the names of the entries in
  the currently selected parameter file.  The default parameter file,
  FRACTINT.PAR, is included with the Fractint release and contains
  parameters for some sample images.

  After pressing &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;, highlight an entry and press &lt;Enter&gt; to load
  it, or press &lt;F6&gt; to change to another parameter file.

  Note that parameter file entries specify all calculation related
  parameters, but do not specify things like the video mode - the image
  will be plotted in your currently selected mode.

  &lt;B&gt;

  The &lt;B&gt; command saves the parameters required to describe the currently
  displayed image, which can subsequently be used with the &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt;
  command to recreate it.

  After you press &lt;B&gt;, Fractint prompts for:

    Parameter file:  The name of the file to store the parameters in.  You
    should use some name like "myimages" instead of fractint.par, so that
    your images are kept separate from the ones released with new versions
    of Fractint. You can use the PARMFILE= command in SSTOOLS.INI to set
    the default parameter file name to "myimages" or whatever.  (See
    "Setting Defaults (SSTOOLS.INI File)" (p. 120) and "parmfile=" in
    "File Parameters" (p. 133).)

    Name:  The name you want to assign to the entry, to be displayed when
    the &lt;@&gt; or &lt;2&gt; command is used.

    Main comment:  A comment to be shown beside the entry in the &lt;@&gt;
    command display.

    Second, Third, and Fourth comment:  Additional comments to store in
    the file with the entry. These comments go in the file only, and are
    not displayed by the &lt;@&gt; command. You can set these comments from the
    command line - see Comment= Command (p. 122).

    Record colors?:  Whether color information should be included in the
    entry. Usually the default value displayed by Fractint is what you
    want.  Allowed values are:
    "no" - Don't record colors.
    "@mapfilename" - When these parameters are used, load colors from the
       named color map file. This is the default if you are currently
       using colors from a color map file.
    "yes" - Record the colors in detail. This is the default when you've
       changed the display colors by using the palette editor or by color
       cycling. The only reason that this isn't what Fractint always does
       for the &lt;B&gt; command is that color information can be bulky - up to
       nearly 3K of disk space per map - which adds up to a lot for many
       images. Smooth-shaded ranges of colors are compressed, so if that's
       used a lot in an image the color information won't be as bulky.
    "only" - Record only the colors in the PAR file, without any other
       parameters. This is useful for converting color maps to PAR
       entries.

    # of colors:  This only matters if "Record colors?" is set to "yes".
    It specifies the number of colors to record. Recording less colors
    will take less space. Usually the default value displayed by Fractint
    is what you want. You might want to increase it in some cases, e.g. if
    you are using a 256 color mode with maxiter 150, and have used the
    palette editor to set all 256 possible colors for use with color
    cycling, then you'll want to set the "# of colors" to 256.

    See the Recordcolors (p. 128) command, which controls when mapfiles
    are used and when compressed colors are written to PAR files.

    maxlinelength: This number controls the maximum width of a parameter
    entry in a PAR file. The default is 72 characters.

    At the bottom of the input screen are inputs for Fractint's "pieces"
    divide-and-conquer feature. You can create multiple PAR entries that
    break an image up into pieces so that you can generate the image
    pieces one by one. There are two reasons for doing this. The first is
    in case the fractal is very slow, and you want to generate parts of
    the image at the same time on several computers. The second is that
    you might want to make an image greater than 2048 x 2048, the old
    pixel limit for Fractint. The parameters for this feature are:
       X Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the x direction
       Y Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the y direction
       Video mode  - Fractint video mode for each piece (e.g. "F3")

    The last item defaults to the current video mode. If either X
    Multiples or Y Multiples are greater than 1, then multiple numbered
    PAR entries for the pieces are added to the PAR file, and a
    MAKEMIG.BAT file is created that builds all of the component pieces
    and then stitches them together into a "multi-image" GIF.  The current
    limitations of the "divide and conquer" algorithm are 36 or fewer X
    and Y multiples (so you are limited to "only" 36x36=1296 component
    images), and a final resolution limit in both the X and Y directions
    of 65,535 (a limitation of "only" four billion pixels or so).

    The final image generated by MAKEMIG is a "multi-image" GIF file
    called FRACTMIG.GIF.  In case you have other software that can't
    handle multi-image GIF files, MAKEMIG includes a final (but commented
    out) call to SIMPLGIF, a companion program that reads a GIF file that
    may contain little tricks like multiple images and creates a simple
    GIF from it.  Fair warning: SIMPLGIF needs room to build a composite
    image while it works, and it does that using a temporary disk file
    equal to the size of the final image - and a 64Kx64K GIF image
    requires a 4GB temporary disk file!

  &lt;G&gt;

  The &lt;G&gt; command lets you give a startup parameter interactively.
