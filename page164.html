 8. Fractals and the PC


 8.1 A Little History


 8.1.1 Before Mandelbrot

  Like new forms of life, new branches of mathematics and science don't
  appear from nowhere. The ideas of fractal geometry can be traced to the
  late nineteenth century, when mathematicians created shapes -- sets of
  points -- that seemed to have no counterpart in nature.  By a wonderful
  irony, the "abstract" mathematics descended from that work has now
  turned out to be MORE appropriate than any other for describing many
  natural shapes and processes.

  Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.  The Greek geometers worked out the
  mathematics of the conic sections for its formal beauty; it was two
  thousand years before Copernicus and Brahe, Kepler and Newton overcame
  the preconception that all heavenly motions must be circular, and found
  the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola in the paths of planets, comets,
  and projectiles.

  In the 17th century Newton and Leibniz created calculus, with its
  techniques for "differentiating" or finding the derivative of functions
  -- in geometric terms, finding the tangent of a curve at any given
  point.  True, some functions were discontinuous, with no tangent at a
  gap or an isolated point. Some had singularities: abrupt changes in
  direction at which the idea of a tangent becomes meaningless. But these
  were seen as exceptional, and attention was focused on the "well-
  behaved" functions that worked well in modeling nature.

  Beginning in the early 1870s, though, a 50-year crisis transformed
  mathematical thinking. Weierstrass described a function that was
  continuous but nondifferentiable -- no tangent could be described at any
  point. Cantor showed how a simple, repeated procedure could turn a line
  into a dust of scattered points, and Peano generated a convoluted curve
  that eventually touches every point on a plane. These shapes seemed to
  fall "between" the usual categories of one-dimensional lines, two-
  dimensional planes and three-dimensional volumes. Most still saw them as
  "pathological" cases, but here and there they began to find
  applications.

  In other areas of mathematics, too, strange shapes began to crop up.
  Poincare attempted to analyze the stability of the solar system in the
  1880s and found that the many-body dynamical problem resisted
  traditional methods. Instead, he developed a qualitative approach, a
  "state space" in which each point represented a different planetary
  orbit, and studied what we would now call the topology -- the
  "connectedness" -- of whole families of orbits. This approach revealed
  that while many initial motions quickly settled into the familiar
  curves, there were also strange, "chaotic" orbits that never became
  periodic and predictable.
