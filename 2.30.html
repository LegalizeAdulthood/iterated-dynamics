 2.30 Pickover Attractors

  (type=pickover)

  Clifford A. Pickover of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research center is such
  a creative source for fractals that we attach his name to this one only
  with great trepidation.  Probably tomorrow he'll come up with another
  one and we'll be back to square one trying to figure out a name!

  This one is the three dimensional orbit defined by:

               xnew = sin(a*y) - z*cos(b*x)
               ynew = z*sin(c*x) - cos(d*y)
               znew = sin(x)

  Default parameters are: a = 2.24, b = .43, c = -.65, d = -2.43
