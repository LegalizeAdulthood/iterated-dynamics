 2.33 Icon

  (type=icon/icon3d)

    This fractal type was inspired by the book "Symmetry in Chaos" by
    Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky (ISBN 0-19-853689-5, Oxford Press)

    To quote from the book's jacket,

      "Field and Golubitsky describe how a chaotic process eventually can
      lead to symmetric patterns (in a river, for instance, photographs of
      the turbulent movement of eddies, taken over time, often reveal
      patterns on the average."

    The Icon type implemented here maps the classic population logistic
    map of bifurcation fractals onto the complex plane in Dn symmetry.

    The initial points plotted are the more chaotic initial orbits, but as
    you wait, delicate webs will begin to form as the orbits settle into a
    more periodic pattern.  Since pixels are colored by the number of
    times they are hit, the more periodic paths will become clarified with
    time.  These fractals run continuously.

  There are 6 parameters:  Lambda, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Omega, and Degree
      Omega  0 = Dn, or dihedral (rotation + reflectional) symmetry
            !0 = Zn, or cyclic (rotational) symmetry
      Degree = n, or Degree of symmetry
