Introduction
============

Iterated Dynamics plots and manipulates images of "objects" -- actually, sets of
mathematical points -- that have fractal dimension.
See :ref:`Fractals and the PC` for some
historical and mathematical background on fractal geometry, a discipline
named and popularized by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. For now, these
sets of points have three important properties:

#. They are generated by relatively simple calculations repeated over and
   over, feeding the results of each step back into the next -- something
   computers can do very rapidly.

#. They are, quite literally, infinitely complex: they reveal more and
   more detail without limit as you plot smaller and smaller areas. Iterated
   Dynamics lets you "zoom in" by positioning a small box and hitting <Enter> to
   redraw the boxed area at full-screen size; its maximum linear
   "magnification" is over a trillionfold.

#. They can be astonishingly beautiful, especially using PC color
   displays' ability to assign colors to selected points, and
   to "animate" the images by quickly shifting those color assignments.

For a demonstration of some of Iterated Dynamics' features, run the demonstration
file included with this release (``DEMO.BAT``) by typing ``demo`` at the command
prompt.  You can stop the demonstration at any time by pressing <Esc>.

The name Iterated Dynamics was chosen because all the images are generated
from iterating some kind of dynamic computation.  Iterated Dynamics is
an evolution of the FRACTINT program, so named because it used integer
math for fast image computation before floating-point hardware was common
on personal computers.

Iterated Dynamics is an experiment in collaboration.  Many volunteers have joined
Bert Tyler, FRACTINT's first author, in improving successive versions.

your own ideas and code.
