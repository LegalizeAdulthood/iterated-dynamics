Getting Started
===============

To start the program, enter Iterated Dynamics at the command prompt. The program
displays an initial "credits" screen. If Iterated Dynamics doesn't start properly,
please see {Common Problems}.

Hitting <Enter> gets you from the initial screen to the main menu. You can
select options from the menu by moving the highlight with the cursor arrow
keys
~Doc-
(\24 \25 \27 \26)
~Doc+
and pressing <Enter>, or you can enter commands directly.

As soon as you select a video mode, Iterated Dynamics begins drawing an image - the
"full" Mandelbrot set if you haven't selected another fractal type.

For a quick start, after starting Iterated Dynamics try one of the following:\
  If you have MCGA, VGA, or better:  <F3>\
  If you have EGA:                   <F9>\
  If you have CGA:                   <F5>\
  Otherwise, monochrome:             <F6>

After the initial Mandelbrot image has been displayed, try zooming
into it (see {Zoom Box Commands}) and color cycling (see
{Color Cycling Commands}).
Once you're comfortable with these basics, start exploring other
functions from the main menu.

Help is available from the menu and at most other points in Iterated Dynamics by
pressing the <F1> key.

AT ANY TIME, you can hit
~Doc-
one of the keys described in {Display Mode Commands}
~Doc+,Online-
a command key
~Online+
to select a function. You do not need to wait for a calculation
to finish, nor do you have to return to the main menu.

When entering commands, note that for the "typewriter" keys, upper and
lower case are equivalent, e.g. <B> and <b> have the same result.

Many commands and parameters can be passed to Iterated Dynamics as command-line
arguments or read from a configuration file;
