 2.22 Unity

  (type=unity)

  This Peterson variation began with curiosity about other "Newton-style"
  approximation processes. A simple one,

     One = (x * x) + (y * y); y = (2 - One) * x;   x = (2 - One) * y;

  produces the fractal called Unity.

  One of its interesting features is the "ghost lines." The iteration loop
  bails out when it reaches the number 1 to within the resolution of a
  screen pixel. When you zoom a section of the image, the bailout
  criterion is adjusted, causing some lines to become thinner and others
  thicker.

  Only one line in Unity that forms a perfect circle: the one at a radius
  of 1 from the origin. This line is actually infinitely thin. Zooming on
  it reveals only a thinner line, up (down?) to the limit of accuracy for
  the algorithm. The same thing happens with other lines in the fractal,
  such as those around |x| = |y| = (1/2)^(1/2) = .7071

  Try some other tortuous approximations using the TEST stub (p. 64) and
  let us know what you come up with!
