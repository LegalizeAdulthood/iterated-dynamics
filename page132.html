 5.10 Doodad Parameters

  LOGMAP=yes|old|n
  Selects a compressed relationship between escape-time iterations and
  palette colors.  See "Logarithmic Palettes and Color Ranges" (p. 93)
  for details.

  LOGMODE=fly/table|auto
  Forces the use of the on-the-fly routine or the logarithm table for the
  calculation of log palettes.  Not normally needed.  The auto option
  cannot be used at the same time as the other two.  Auto causes the
  logmap value to be automatically recalculated when zooming.  Changing
  almost anything will turn this feature off.  Set logmode=auto from the
  &lt;g&gt; screen prompt.

  RANGES=nn/nn/nn/...
  Specifies ranges of escape-time iteration counts to be mapped to each
  color number.  See "Logarithmic Palettes and Color Ranges" (p. 93) for
  details.

  DISTEST=nnn/nnn
  A nonzero value in the first parameter enables the distance estimator
  method. The second parameter specifies the "width factor", defaults to
  71.  See "Distance Estimator Method" (p. 91) for details.

  DECOMP=2|4|8|16|32|64|128|256
  Invokes the corresponding decomposition coloring scheme.  See
  Decomposition (p. 93) for details.

  BIOMORPH=nnn
  Turn on biomorph option; set affected pixels to color nnn.  See
  Biomorphs (p. 95) for details.

  POTENTIAL=maxcolor[/slope[/modulus[/16bit]]]
  Enables the "continuous potential" coloring mode for all fractal types
  except plasma clouds, attractor types such as lorenz, and IFS. The four
  arguments define the maximum color value, the slope of the potential
  curve, the modulus "bailout" value, and whether 16 bit values are to be
  calculated.  Example: "POTENTIAL=240/2000/40/16bit". The Mandelbrot and
  Julia types ignore the modulus bailout value and use their own hardwired
  value of 4.0 instead.  See Continuous Potential (p. 95) for details.

  INVERT=nn/nn/nn
  Turns on inversion. The parameters are radius of inversion, x-coordinate
  of center, and y-coordinate of center. -1 as the first parameter sets
  the radius to 1/6 the smaller screen dimension; no x/y parameters
  defaults to center of screen. The values are displayed with the &lt;Tab&gt;
  command.  See Inversion (p. 92) for details.

  FINATTRACT=no|yes
  Another option to show coloring inside some Julia "lakes" to show escape
  time to finite attractors. Works with lambda, magnet types, and possibly
  others.  See Finite Attractors (p. 185) for more information.
