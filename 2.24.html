 2.24 Kam Torus

  (type=kamtorus, kamtorus3d)

  This type is created by superimposing orbits generated by a set of
  equations, with a variable incremented each time.

           x(0) = y(0) = orbit/3;
           x(n+1) = x(n)*cos(a) + (x(n)*x(n)-y(n))*sin(a)
           y(n+1) = x(n)*sin(a) - (x(n)*x(n)-y(n))*cos(a)

  After each orbit, 'orbit' is incremented by a step size. The parameters
  are angle "a", step size for incrementing 'orbit', stop value for
  'orbit', and points per orbit. Try this with a stop value of 5 with
  sound=x for some weird fractal music (ok, ok, fractal noise)! You will
  also see the KAM Torus head into some chaotic territory that Scott
  Taylor wanted to hide from you by setting the defaults the way he did,
  but now we have revealed all!

  The 3D variant is created by treating 'orbit' as the z coordinate.

  With both variants, you can adjust the "maxiter" value (&lt;X&gt; options
  screen or parameter maxiter=) to change the number of orbits plotted.
