 4.9 Special Note for CGA or Hercules Users

  If you are one of those unfortunates with a CGA or Hercules 2-color
  monochrome graphics, it is now possible for you to make 3D projection
  images.

  Try the following unfortunately circuitous approach. Invoke Fractint,
  making sure you have set askvideo=yes. Use a disk-video mode to create a
  256 color fractal. You might want to edit the fractint.cfg file to make
  a disk-video mode with the same pixel dimensions as your normal video.
  Using the "3" command, enter the file name of the saved 256 color file,
  then select your 2 or 4 color mode, and answer the other 3D prompts. You
  will then see a 3D projection of the fractal. Another example of Stone
  Soup responsiveness to our fan mail!
