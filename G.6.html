  Version 15.11, 3/91, companion to Fractal Creations, not for general
  release

    Autokey feature, IIT fpu support, and some bug fixes publicly released
    in version 16.

  Version 15 and 15.1, 12/90

    New user interface! Enjoy! Some key assignments have changed and some
      have been removed.
    New palette editing from Ethan Nagel.
    Reduced memory requirements - Fractint now uses overlays and will run
      on a 512K machine.
    New &lt;v&gt;iew command: use to get small window for fast preview, or to
      setup an image which will eventually be rendered on hard copy with
      different aspect ratio
    L-System fractal type from Adrian Mariano
    Postscript printer support from Scott Taylor
    Better Tandy video support and faster CGA video from Joseph A Albrecht
    16 bit continuous potential files have changed considerably;  see the
      Continuous Potential section for details.  Continuous potential is
      now resumable.
    Mandelbrot calculation is faster again (thanks to Mike Gelvin) -
      double speed in 8086 32 bit case
    Compressed log palette and sqrt palette from Chuck Ebbert
    Calculation automatically resumes whenever current image is resumable
      and is not paused for a visible reason.
    Auto increment of savename changed to be more predictable
    New video modes:
      trident 1024x768x256 mode
      320x480x256 tweak mode (good for reduced 640x480 viewing)
      changed NEC GB-1, hopefully it works now
    Integer mandelbrot and julia now work with periodicitycheck
    Initial zoombox color auto-picked for better contrast (usually)
    New adapter=cga|ega|mcga|vga for systems having trouble with auto-
    detect
    New textsafe=no|yes for systems having trouble with garbled text mode
    &lt;r&gt; and &lt;3&gt; commands now present list of video modes to pick from; &lt;r&gt;
      can reduce a non-standard or unviewable image size.
    Diffusion fractal type is now resumable after interrupt/save
    Exitmode=n parameter, sets video mode to n when exiting from fractint
    When savetime is used with 1 and 2 pass and solid guessing, saves are
      deferred till the beginning of a new row, so that no calculation
      time is lost.
    3d photographer's mode now allows the first image to be saved to disk
    textcolors=mono|12/34/56/... -- allows setting user interface colors
    Code (again!) compilable under TC++ (we think!)
    .TIW files (from v9.3) are no longer supported as input to 3D
      transformations
    bug fixes:
      multiple restores (msc 6.0, fixed in 14.0r)
      repeating 3d loads problem; slow 3d loads of images with float=yes
      map= is now a real substitute for default colors
      starfield and julibrot no longer cause permanent color map
      replacement
      starfield parameters bug fix - if you couldn't get the starfield
      parameters to do anything interesting before, try again with this
      release
      Newton and newtbasin orbit display fixed Fixed startup and text
    screen problems on systems with VESA compliant
      video adapters.  New textsafe=save|bios options.
    Fixes for EGA with monochrome monitor, and for Hercules Graphics Card.
      Both should now be auto-detected and operate correctly in text
      modes.  Options adapter=egamono and adapter=hgc added.
    Fixed color L-Systems to not use color 0 (black).
    PostScript printing fix.
