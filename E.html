 Appendix E Bibliography

  BARNSLEY, Michael: "Fractals Everywhere," Academic Press, 1988.

  DAVENPORT, Clyde: "A Hypercomplex Calculus with Applications to
     Relativity", ISBN 0-9623837-0-8. This self-published expansion of Mr.
     Davenport's Master's thesis makes the case for using hypercomplex
     numbers rather than quaternions. This book provided the background
     for Fractint's implementation of hypercomplex fractals.

  DEWDNEY, A. K., "Computer Recreations" columns in "Scientific American"
     -- 8/85, 7/87, 11/87, 12/88, 7/89.

  FEDER, Jens: "Fractals," Plenum, 1988.
     Quite technical, with good coverage of applications in fluid
     percolation, game theory, and other areas.

  GLEICK, James: "Chaos: Making a New Science," Viking Press, 1987.
     The best non-technical account of the revolution in our understanding
     of dynamical systems and its connections with fractal geometry.

  MANDELBROT, Benoit: "The Fractal Geometry of Nature," W. H. Freeman &amp;
     Co., 1982.
     An even more revised and expanded version of the 1977 work. A rich
     and sometimes confusing stew of formal and informal mathematics, the
     prehistory of fractal geometry, and everything else. Best taken in
     small doses.

  MANDELBROT, Benoit: "Fractals: Form, Chance, and Dimension," W. H.
     Freeman &amp; Co., 1977.
     A much revised translation of "Les objets fractals: forme, hasard, et
     dimension," Flammarion, 1975.

  PEITGEN, Heinz-Otto &amp; RICHTER, Peter: "The Beauty of Fractals,"
     Springer-Verlag, 1986.
     THE coffee-table book of fractal images, knowledgeable on computer
     graphics as well as the mathematics they portray.

  PEITGEN, Heinz-Otto &amp; SAUPE, Ditmar: "The Science of Fractal Images,"
     Springer-Verlag, 1988.
     A fantastic work, with a few nice pictures, but mostly filled with
     *equations*!!!

  PICKOVER, Clifford: "Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty," St.
     Martin's Press, 1990.

  SCHROEDER, Manfred: "Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws," W. H. Freeman &amp; Co.,
     1991.

  WEGNER, Timothy: "Image Lab, Second Edition", Waite Group Press, 1995.
     Learn how to create fractal animations, fractal RDS stereo images,
     and how to use Fractint with other image creation and processing
     tools such as Piclab, POV-Ray and Polyray ray tracers.

  WEGNER, Timothy &amp; TYLER, Bert: "Fractal Creations, Second Edition" Waite
     Group Press, 1993
     This is the definitive Fractint book. Spectacular color plate
     section, totally new and expanded fractal type descriptions,
     annotated PAR files, source code secrets, and a CD filled to the brim
     with spectacular fractals.

  WEGNER, Timothy, TYLER, Bert, PETERSON, Mark, and Branderhorst, Pieter:
     "Fractals for Windows," Waite Group Press, 1992.
     This book is to Winfract (the Windows version of Fractint) what
     "Fractal Creations" is to Fractint.
