 3.13 Random Dot Stereograms (RDS)

  Random Dot Stereograms (RDS) are a way of encoding stereo images on a
  flat screen. Fractint can convert any image to a RDS using either the
  color number in the current palette or the grayscale value as depth. Try
  these steps. Generate a plasma fractal using the 640x480x256 video mode.
  When the image on the screen is complete, press &lt;ctrl-s&gt; ("s" for
  "Stereo"), and press &lt;Enter&gt; at the "RDS Parameters" screen prompt to
  accept the defaults. (More on the parameters in a moment.) The screen
  will be converted into a seemingly random collection of colored dots.
  Relax your eyes, looking through the screen rather than at the screen
  surface. The image will (hopefully) resolve itself into the hills and
  valleys of the 3D Plasma fractal.

  Because pressing the two-keyed &lt;ctrl-s&gt; gets tiresome after a while, we
  have made &lt;k&gt; key a synonym for &lt;ctrl-s&gt; for convenience.  Don't get too
  attached to &lt;k&gt; though; we reserve the right to reuse it for another
  purpose later.

  The RDS feature has five and sometimes six parameters. Pressing &lt;ctrl-s&gt;
  always takes you to the parameter screen.

  The first parameter allows you to control the depth effect. A larger
  value (positive or negative) exaggerates the sense of depth. If you make
  the depth negative, the high and low areas of the image are reversed. If
  your RDS image is streaky try either a lower depth factor or a higher
  resolution.

  The second parameter indicates the overall width in inches of the image
  on your monitor or printout. The default value of 10 inches is roughly
  the width of an image on a standard 14" to 16" monitor. This value does
  not normally need to be changed for viewing images on standard monitors.
  However, if your monitor or image hardcopy is much wider or narrower
  than 10 inches (25 cm), and you have trouble seeing the image, enter the
  image width in inches. The issue here is that if the widest separation
  of left and right pixels is greater than the physical separation of your
  eyes, you will not be able to fuse the images. Conversely, a too-small
  separation may cause your eyes to hyper-converge (fuse the wrong pixels
  together). A larger width value reduces the width between left and right
  pixels. You can use the calibration feature to help set the width
  parameter - see below. Once you have found a good width setting, you can
  place the value in your SSTOOLS.INI file with the command
  monitorwidth=&lt;nnn&gt;.

  The third parameter allows you to control the method use to extract
  depth information from the original image. If your answer "no" at the
  "Use Grayscale value for Depth" prompt, then the color number of each
  pixel will be used.  This value is independent of active color palette.
  If you answer "yes" and the prompt, then the depth values are keyed to
  the brightness of the color, which will change if you change palettes.

  The fourth parameter allows you to set the position of vertical stereo
  calibration bars to the middle or the top of the image, or have the bars
  initially turned off. Use this feature to help you adjust your eye's
  convergence to see the image. You will see two vertical bars on the
  screen.  You can turn off and on these bars with the &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Space&gt;
  keys after generating the RDS image. If you save an RDS image by
  pressing &lt;s&gt;, if the bars are turned on at the time, they become a
  permanent part of the image.

  As you relax your eyes and look past the screen, these bars will appear
  as four bars. When you adjust your eyes so that the two middle bars
  merge into one bar, the 3D image should appear. The bars are set for the
  average depth in the area near the bars. They should always be closer
  together than the physical separation of your eyes, but not much less
  than about 1.5 inches.  About 1.75 inches is ideal for many images. The
  depth and screen width controls affect the width of the bars.

  At the RDS Parameters screen, you can select bars at the middle of the
  screen or the top. If you select "none", the bars will initially be off,
  but immediately after generation of the image you can still turn on the
  bars with &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Space&gt; before you press any other keys. If the
  initial setting of the calibration bars is "none", then if the bars are
  turned on later they will appear in the middle. Hint: if you cycle the
  colors and find you can't see the calibration bar, press &lt;Enter&gt; or
  &lt;Space&gt; twice, and the bars will turn to a more visible color.

  The fifth parameter asks if you want to use an image map GIF file
  instead of using random dots. An image map can give your RDS image a
  more interesting background texture than the random dots. If you answer
  "yes" at the Use image map? prompt, Fractint will present you with a
  file selection list of GIF images. Fractint will then go ahead and
  transform your original image to RDS using the selected image map to
  provide the "random" dots.

  After you have selected an image map file, the next time you reach the
  RDS Parameters screen you will see an additional prompt asking if you
  want to use the same image map file again. Answering "yes" avoids the
  file selection menu.

  The best images to use as image maps are detailed textures with no solid
  spots. The default type=circle fractal works well, as do the barnsley
  fractals if you zoom in a little way. If the image map is smaller than
  your RDS image, the image map will repeated to fill the space. If the
  image map is larger, just the upper left corner of the image map will be
  used.

  The original image you are using for your stereogram is saved, so if you
  want to modify the stereogram parameters and try again, just press
  &lt;ctrl-s&gt; (or &lt;k&gt;) to get the parameter screen, changes the parameters,
  and press &lt;Enter&gt;. The original image is restored and an RDS transform
  with the revised parameters is performed. If you press &lt;s&gt; when viewing
  an RDS image, after the RDS image is saved, the original is restored.

  Try the RDS feature with continuous potential Mandelbrots as well as
  plasma fractals.
