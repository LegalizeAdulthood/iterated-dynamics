 3.6 Decomposition

  You'll remember that most fractal types are calculated by iterating a
  simple function of a complex number, producing another complex number,
  until either the number exceeds some pre-defined "bailout" value, or the
  iteration limit is reached. The pixel corresponding to the starting
  point is then colored based on the result of that calculation.

  The decomposition option ("decomp=", on the &lt;X&gt; screen) toggles to
  another coloring protocol.  Here the points are colored according to
  which quadrant of the complex plane (negative real/positive imaginary,
  positive real/positive imaginary, etc.) the final value is in. If you
  use 4 as the parameter, points ending up in each quadrant are given
  their own color; if 2 (binary decomposition), points in alternating
  quadrants are given 2 alternating colors.

  The result is a kind of warped checkerboard coloring, even in areas that
  would ordinarily be part of a single contour. Remember, for the M-set
  all points whose final values exceed 2 (by any amount) after, say, 80
  iterations are normally the same color; under decomposition, Fractint
  runs [bailout-value] iterations and then colors according to where the
  actual final value falls on the complex plane.

  When using decomposition, a higher bailout value will give a more
  accurate plot, at some expense in speed.  You might want to set the
  bailout value (in the parameters prompt following selection of a new
  fractal type; present for most but not all types) to a higher value than
  the default.  A value of about 50 is a good compromise for M/J sets.
