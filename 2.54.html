 2.54 Mandelbrot Mix 4

  (type=mandelbrotmix4)

  Jim Muth has been publishing a "Fractal of the Day" on the fractint
  mailing list for many years now. As often as not Jim picks the formula
  Mandelbrotmix4 as the fractal continent to explore. To honor Jim, the
  fractint authors have provided this fractal as a built-in type.

  The formula is:

  MandelbrotMix4 {; Jim Muth a=real(p1), b=imag(p1), d=real(p2),
  f=imag(p2), g=1/f, h=1/d, j=1/(f-b), z=(-a*b*g*h)^j, k=real(p3)+1,
  l=imag(p3)+100, c=fn1(pixel): z=k*((a*(z^b))+(d*(z^f)))+c, |z| &lt; l }

  Note that Jim uses l=imag(p3)+100, which is to say, the sixth scalar
  parameter, as the bailout. Our implementation follows Jim if the user
  requests the default bailout.
