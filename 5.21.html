 5.21 Passes Parameters

  PERIODICITY=no|show|nnn
  Controls periodicity checking (see Periodicity Logic (p. 166)).  "no"
  turns it off, "show" lets you see which pixels were painted as "inside"
  due to being caught by periodicity.  Specifying a number causes a more
  conservative periodicity test (each increase of 1 divides test tolerance
  by 2).  Entering a negative number lets you turn on "show" with that
  number. Type lambdafn function=exp needs periodicity turned off to be
  accurate -- there may be other cases.

  A non-zero value of the "periodicity=" option causes "passes=o" to not
  plot orbits that have reached the bailout conditions or where an orbit
  goes off the visible area of the image.  A zero value of periodicity
  will plot all orbits except as modified by orbitdelay and orbitinterval.

  ORBITDELAY=&lt;nn&gt;
  This option controls how many orbits are computed before the orbits are
  displayed on the screen when using the "passes=o" option, or the fractal
  types mandelcloud and dynamic.  This allows the orbits to settle down
  before plotting starts.

  This option also slows down the display of orbits using the &lt;O&gt; command
  for folks with hot new computers. Units are in 1/10000 seconds per orbit
  point.  ORBITDELAY=10 therefore allows you to see each pixel's orbit
  point for about one millisecond. For best display of orbits, try
  passes=1 and a moderate resolution such as 320x200.  Note that the first
  time you press the 'O' key with the 'orbitdelay' function active, your
  computer will pause for a half-second or so to calibrate a high-
  resolution timer.

  ORBITINTERVAL=&lt;nn&gt;
  This parameter causes "passes=o" to plot every nth orbit point ranging
  from 1, which plots every orbit, to 255, which plots every 255th orbit.
  This value must be lower than the value of maxit to make any sense.

  SCREENCOORDS=yes|no
  This parameter maintains the screen coordinates and lets you zoom into
  an image changing the coordinates of the line or rectangle used to
  generate the image, but keeps the display coordinates the same.  The
  screen coordinates can be zoomed, rotated, and skewed using the &lt;F2&gt;
  Screen Coordinates Screen (p. 151).  If set to no, the screen and image
  coordinates are maintained the same when an image is zoomed.
  ORBITDRAWMODE=rect|line
  The rect(angle) method plots the orbits in a rectangle that can be
  zoomed, rotated, and skewed using the &lt;F6&gt; Image Coordinates Screen
  (p. 151), and the straight line method plots the orbits between two
  points specified on the &lt;F6&gt; image coordinates screen.
