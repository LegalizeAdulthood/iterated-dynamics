  adjusting the contrast of the final image. Use the "Ambient= " variable.
  In addition to being able to create scenes with light sources in
  monochrome, you can now do it in full color as well. Setting fullcolor=1
  will generate a Targa-24 file with a full color image which will be a
  combination of the original colors of the source image (or map file if
  you select map=something) and the amount of light which reflects off a
  given point on the surface. Since there can be 256 different colors in
  the original image and 256 levels of light, you can now generate an
  image with *lots* of colors. To convert it to a GIF if you can't view
  Targa files directly, you can use PICLAB (see Other Programs (p. 203)),
  and the following commands:

      SET PALETTE 256
      SET CREZ 8
      TLOAD yourfile.tga
      MAKEPAL
      MAP
      GSAVE yourfile.gif
      EXIT
  Using the full color option allows you to also set a haze factor with
  the "haze= " variable to make more distant objects more hazy.

  As a default, full color files also have the background set to sky blue.
  Warning, the files which are created with the full color option are very
  large, 3 bytes per pixel. So be sure to use a disk with enough space.
  The file is created using Fractint's disk-video caching, but is always
  created on real disk (expanded or extended memory is not used.) Try the
  following settings of the new variables in sequence to get a feel for
  the effect of each one:
      ;use this with any filltype
      map=topo
      randomize=3; adjusting this smooths color transitions

      ;now add this using filltype 5 or 6
      ambient=20; adjusting this changes the contrast
      filltype=6
      smoothing=2; makes the light not quite as granular as the terrain

      ;now add the following, and this is where it gets slow
      fullcolor=1; use PICLAB to reduce resulting lightfile to a GIF

      ;and finally this
      haze=20; sets the amount of haze for distant objects

  When full color is being used, the image you see on the screen will
  represent the amount of light being reflected, not the colors in the
  final image. Don't be disturbed if the colors look weird, they are an
  artifact of the process being used. The image being created in the
  lightfile won't look like the screen.

  However, if you are worried, hit ESC several times and when Fractint
  gets to the end of the current line it will abort. Your partial image
  will be there as LIGHT001.TGA or with whatever file name you selected
  with the lightname option. Convert it as described above and adjust any
  parameters you are not happy with. Its a little awkward, but we haven't
  figured out a better way yet.
