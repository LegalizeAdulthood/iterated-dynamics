 2.16 Sierpinski Gasket

  (type=sierpinski)

  Another pre-Mandelbrot classic, this one found by W. Sierpinski around
  World War I. It is generated by dividing a triangle into four congruent
  smaller triangles, doing the same to each of them, and so on, yea, even
  unto infinity. (Notice how hard we try to avoid reiterating
  "iterating"?)

  If you think of the interior triangles as "holes", they occupy more and
  more of the total area, while the "solid" portion becomes as hopelessly
  fragile as that gasket you HAD to remove without damaging it -- you
  remember, that Sunday afternoon when all the parts stores were closed?
  There's a three-dimensional equivalent using nested tetrahedrons instead
  of triangles, but it generates too much pyramid power to be safely
  unleashed yet.

  There are no parameters for this type. We were able to implement it with
  integer math routines, so it runs fairly quickly even without an FPU.
