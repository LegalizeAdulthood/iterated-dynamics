 2.53 Latoocarfian

  (type=latoocarfian)

  This fractal type first appeared in the book "Chaos in Wonderland" by
  Clifford Pickover (ISBN 0-312-10743-9 St. Martin's Press)

  The Latoocarfians are beings that inhabit the moon Ganymede (of Jupiter)
  and have their forms generated by these formulas.

  The initial points plotted are the more chaotic initial orbits, but as
  you wait, delicate webs will begin to form as the orbits settle into a
  more periodic pattern.  Since pixels are colored by the number of times
  they are hit, the more periodic paths will become clarified with time.

  There are 4 parameters: a, b, c, d and we recomend: a &gt; -3,  b &lt; 3,  c &gt;
  0.5, d &lt; 1.5
