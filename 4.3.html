 4.3 Stereo 3D Viewing

  The "Funny Glasses" (stereo 3D) parameter screen is presented only if
  you select a non-zero stereo option in the prior 3D parameters.  (See 3D
  Mode Selection (p. 106).)  We suggest you definitely use defaults at
  first on this screen.

  When you look at an image with both eyes, each eye sees the image in
  slightly different perspective because they see it from different
  places.

  The first selection you must make is ocular separation, the distance the
  between the viewers eyes. This is measured as a % of screen and is an
  important factor in setting the position of the final stereo image in
  front of or behind the CRT Screen.

  The second selection is convergence, also as a % of screen. This tends
  to move the image forward and back to set where it floats. More positive
  values move the image towards the viewer. The value of this parameter
  needs to be set in conjunction with the setting of ocular separation and
  the perspective distance. It directly adjusts the overall separation of
  the two stereo images. Beginning anaglyphers love to create images
  floating mystically in front of the screen, but grizzled old 3D veterans
  look upon such antics with disdain, and believe the image should be
  safely inside the monitor where it belongs!

  Left and Right Red and Blue image crop (% of screen also) help keep the
  visible part of the right image the same as the visible part of the left
  by cropping them. If there is too much in the field of either eye that
  the other doesn't see, the stereo effect can be ruined.

  Red and Blue brightness factor. The generally available red/blue-green
  glasses, made for viewing on ink on paper and not the light from a CRT,
  let in more red light in the blue-green lens than we would like. This
  leaves a ghost of the red image on the blue-green image (definitely not
  desired in stereo images). We have countered this by adjusting the
  intensity of the red and blue values on the CRT. In general you should
  not have to adjust this.

  The final entry is Map file name (present only if stereo=1 or stereo=2
  was selected).  If you have a special map file you want to use for
  Stereo 3D this is the place to enter its name. Generally glasses1.map is
  for type 1 (alternating pixels), and glasses2.map is for type 2
  (superimposed pixels). Grid.map is great for wire-frame images using 16
  color modes.

  This screen is not available if you have selected a ray tracing option.
