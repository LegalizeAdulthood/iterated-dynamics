  Version 19.6 (5/97) new features include:

  Added new fractal types escher_julia (p. 83) and volterra-lotka
    (p. 82) courtesy Michael Sargent.

  Expanded formula parser capability to recognize "if..else" flow control
    instructions. The format of an "if block" of instructions is:
           IF(boolean)
              statements
           ELSEIF(boolean) [any number of these are permitted in a block]
              statements
           ELSE            [if used, only one is permitted in a block]
              statements
           ENDIF
    Note that ELSEIF() does not require a separate ENDIF. Each branching
    instruction must be a separate formula statement, separated from other
    statements by a comma or an end of line. There is a limit of 200
    branching instructions per formula (ELSEIF counts as two branching
    instructions).  Unlimited nesting is permitted; each ELSEIF, ELSE, and
    ENDIF relates to the immediately preceding "non endif'ed" IF. An IF()
    and its ENDIF cannot traverse the end of the initialization section of
    the formula.

  Added tutorials to the distribution package: Bradley Beacham's basic
    formula tutorial, Sylvie Gallet's PHC and PTC formula tutorial, and
    George Martin's tutorial on the new if..else feature of the formula
    parser. Required reading for formula writers.

  Added text scrolling capability in &lt;z&gt; and F2 screens. Scroll keys for
    the &lt;z&gt; screen:
           CTRL+DOWN_ARROW    Move screen down one line
           CTRL+UP_ARROW      Move screen up one line
           CTRL+RIGHT_ARROW   Move screen right one column
           CTRL+LEFT_ARROW    Move screen left one column
           CTRL+PAGE_DOWN     Move screen down one view screen
           CTRL+PAGE_UP       Move screen up one view screen
           CTRL+HOME          Go to beginning of entry
           CTRL+END           Go to end of entry

    Direction keys without the CONTROL key depressed maintain their
    current roles in moving the cursor in the entry prompt boxes.

    In the F2 screen, the same scrolling is available; the CONTROL key
    does not need to be depressed.

  Added capability to place ifs, formula, and lsys entries in PAR files.
    If not found in the file named in the parameter entry, formulas, ifs,
    and lsystem entries called for in entries are looked for in the .par
    file itself. The referenced entry must have the appropriate prefix in
    the PAR file as follows:

         formulas  frm:
         lsystem   lsys:
         ifs       ifs:

    for example:

    frm:mandel {
      z=c=pixel:
      z = z*z + c
      |z| &lt; 4
    }

    The prefix is an identifier, not part of the name itself. Thus, the
    parameter in the image entry would read "formulaname=mandel". The
    formulafile= parameter need not, and probably should not, name the PAR
    file itself - the search of the PAR file is automatic.

    Formulas, ifs, and lsys entries in a PAR file will not be shown on the
    menu screen for the PAR file, and are accessible only in connection
    with running the parameter entry which calls for the formula. Also,
    PAR files are not searched when looking for a formula, ifs, or lsystem
    entry in connection with restoring a .gif file. You will need to copy
    these entries from the PAR file into .frm, .ifs, and .l files as
    applicable (taking care, of course, to delete the identifier prefixes)
    in order to make general use of them.

  Added command line option fastrestore=yes|no. Default is NO. When YES,
    causes viewwindows to be set to NO before each restore, so that
    otherwise normal gifs will not be drawn at the reduced aspect when
    viewwindows was previously set to YES; and bypasses the warning which
    is displayed when a restore is to be viewed in a video mode other than
    the one at which the gif was saved. Combined with askvideo=no, all
    restores will automatically be made at the user's default video mode.
    This feature will be helpful when cycling through a group of gifs in
    autokey mode.

  Ctrl-Right used in file selection screens now skips over directory
    listings, and if the cursor is on the last file, moves the cursor to
    the first file.  This makes possible uninterrupted cycling in autokey
    mode. The keyword for this keystroke in a .key file is CTRL_RIGHT.
    The following additional keystrokes were also implemented:

         Ctrl-Left (autokey symbol "CTRL_LEFT")
         Ctrl-Down ("CTRL_DOWN")
         Ctrl-Up   ("CTRL_UP")
         Ctrl-Home ("CTRL_HOME")
         Ctrl-End  ("CTRL_END")

     Run the following .key file with command line parameters
     fastrestore=yes and askvideo=no (and, if you don't set your video
     mode in sstools.ini, video=[your standard video mode]) and your
     coworkers will get a continuous display of the .gif files in your
     default .gif directory when you go to lunch (come on, we know you
     have Fractint on your hard drive at work):

           "r"
            MORE:
            ENTER
            CALCWAIT
            WAIT 30
            "R"
            CTRL_RIGHT
            GOTO MORE

  Added four new lsystem types to fractint.l.

  When palette editing mode is entered, the original palette is now stored
    in the area associated with F2.

  Reduced the fractint.cfg resolution limit to 2x2 pixels.

  Fixed bug which caused a lockup when ranges= was used with maxit &gt;=
  32767.

  Fixed arbitrary precision and decoder crashes.

  Fixed an entry display scrolling bug.

  Fixed the integer mode frothy basin "censored" bug.

  Added backwards compatibility for inside=startrails.

  Fixed the 16-color color cycling inside the palette editor.  Fixed color
    cycling when used with a maxit &gt; 32767.  Pixels with iterations &gt;
    32767 now cycle in the same direction as those with iterations &lt;=
    32767.

  Fixed bug which caused an apparent lockup when find finite attractor was
    used with maxit &gt; 32767.

  Fixed viewwindows bug that caused extra points to be written when ydots
    was not divisible by 4.

  Fixed Ant type so that it works with 16 digits.  Old pars will need to
    be re-entered or have a decimal point added to the first two
    parameters.

  Changed MAXSTRING in the decoder from 64000 to 60000. This change
    eliminates all the encoder bug examples we have, but we don't
    understand why it works and we may not have fixed the problem.

  Fixed the logmap routine when used with a par/gif release &lt;= 1920 and
    memory for the LogTable is insufficient.

  Fixed the complexnewton type when used with a par/gif release &lt;= 1920.

  Changed the keystroke behavior of the passes= field on the &lt;x&gt; screen.

  New logic autocenters all input screen menu titles.

  Changed the automatic resolution switching logic between float and
    arbitrary precision.

  If user aborts before selecting a file in a file menu screen, the
    program now remembers the last file name selected even if the
    directory has been changed.

  Fixed writing 3d smooth factor to PAR.

  Fixed writing potential to PAR in makepar mode.

  Fixed redundant "Regenerate before &lt;b&gt; to get correct symmetry" messages
    in divide and conquer mode.

  Fixed hi rez type 2 diffusion bug and parser error bug.

  Fixed crashing in disk video with too long a savename path.

  Added Adrian Mariano's diffusion fixes - a new color option, several bug
    fixes, and improved documentation. Removed integer support which
    wasn't being used anyway.

  Finally, we've added two undocumented commands to give expert users
     workarounds for math type precision and GIF encoder problems.

  Added the mathtolerance=.05/.05 command. The first number controls the
    integer/float transition, and the second number controls the
    float/arbitrary precision transition. The default value of .05 means
    that the ratio between the exact and calculated width and height is
    between .95 and 1.05. A larger value than .05 (say .10) makes the test
    looser so that the lower precision math is used longer. A value &lt;= 0
    means the test is always failed and the higher precision math type is
    used. A value &gt;= 1 means that the test is always passed and the lower
    precision math type is used.

    The automatic precision toggle is resolution dependent. The same image
    may use float at 320x200 and arbitrary precision at 640x480. This is
    not a bug; it has to work this way. At a given magnification more
    pixels require more precision. There are other tests so even with
    mathtolerance=1/.05, eventually Fractint will have to use float. The
    same is not true for mathtolerance=.05/1. If you keep zooming Fractint
    will not rescue you; eventually you'll get a nasty error message and
    the corners will be lost.

  Added the tweaklzw=nnn/nnn command. Fractint's GIF encoder occasionally
    fails and produces bad GIF files. Tweaking encoder parameters might
    allow saving in such a situation. The parameters reduce the maximum
    size of the current string and maximum total length of the string
    table, respectively. The default values are 0, which gives the old
    encoder performance.

  Version 19.5 is a bug-fix release for version 19.4 based on the
    developer's version 19.40 patch 11. As always, we added a few new
    features along with the bug fixes.

  New Comment= command (p. 122). You can automatically set any of the four
    PAR comments, and can include variables in the comments such as the
    much-requested $calctime$ and $date$. Fractint now writes ';;' for
    empty comments above the last comment from the comment= command. This
    prevents comments from moving positions when the PAR is reloaded.

  New recordcolors= command (p. 128). If you place recordcolors=y in your
    SSTOOLS.INI, compressed colors will always be written in your PARS. If
    you want to remember what the map file was (assuming the colors were
    loaded from one), try recordcolors=c. This is exactly like
    recordcolors=y except that the map file (if any) is written to a
    parfile comment.

  Added new parser constants:
    1. whitesq parser constant = (row+col)&amp;1
    2. scrnpix parser constant = (col,row)
    3. scrnmax parser constant = (xdots, ydots)
    4. maxit   parser constant = (maxit,0)

  Added "\" linewrap for formula files.

  Made the round function consistent in all modes. Now round(z) is always
    (floor(x+.5)+i*floor(y+.5)). In version 19.4, in floating point mode
    with type=formula, round() used the coprocessor "nearest or even"
    rounding. Version 19.5 always rounds xxx.5 up.

  Fixed a bug that caused a crash when zooming out with certain functions
    in integer mode.

  Fixed a bug that caused a crash when attempting 3d=overlay without a
    filename in batch mode.

  Fixed a bug that caused part of the video table to not show when
    compiled by Borland.

  Fixed a bug that kept the last image browsed from showing up when you
    regenerate an image and then start the browser again.

  Fixed a bug that loaded images with the wrong aspect ratio when using
    the browser with the view window turned on, and the file image size
    was not the same as the screen image size.
  Version 19.4 is a bug-fix release for version 19.3 based on the
    developer's version 19.30 patch 18. But a few new features did slip in
    when we weren't looking.

  New functions are now available for type=formula and general function
    variable use. They are the rounding functions: floor(), ceil(),
    trunc(), and round()

  New larger showdot "turtle" to enable better seeing which pixel is
    currently being calculated. The syntax is showdot=&lt;color&gt;/&lt;size&gt;, but
    the color parameter can now be one of auto, bright, medium, and dark
    in addition to the previously-supported color number value.

  The &lt;g&gt; command now remembers the last command.

  Added the ability to load images into a view window.  This can be used
    with the browser to browse images larger than the current image.

  Added George Martin's new integrated entry-finding code. Fractint is now
    more tolerant of text between entries, and the internal code is much
    cleaner than before.

  Added Bert Tyler's new VESA truecolor video drivers. These don't do
    anything yet; we've just added the video drivers for testing. Work
    goes on ...
    To test out the new modes, try fractint debug=500 type=test and select
    a new truecolor mode. They only work with video boards having VESA
    truecolor support. Some "non-standard VESA" modes (an unfortunate
    oxymoron if there ever was one) can also be supported by editing
    FRACTINT.CFG. These vendor-specific "VESA" modes tend to make Bert,
    our video expert, real grumpy ...

  Now for the squashed bugs report:

  Ranges is working again.

  Fixed a browser bug that caused a crash when the browser cross-hairs
    become too small.

  Fixed a bug which put the browser into an infinite loop if the history
    feature was used to try and access a deleted or renamed image that was
    still in the history stack.

  Fixed bug that caused any command with greater than 16 parameters to
    fail, most notably textcolors and ranges.

  Fixed a center-mag&lt;-&gt;corners conversion bug that occurred with rotated
    images.  arbitrary precision also (test with debug=3200).

  Fixed bug that allowed the matherr debugging file to grow arbitrarily
    large.  Matherr file is limited to 100 messages for each fractal.

  Fixed bug that affected some Icons3d types, which were broken due to a
    very subtle bug in apparently good code caused by the compiler
    optimizer.

  Version 19.3 is a bug-fix release for version 19.2 based on the
    developer's version 19.21 patch 30.

  The biggest changes from 19.2 to 19.3 are the fixing of the color logmap
    function for maximum iterations greater than 32K, and a large increase
    in the maximum size of an individual formula and the maximum number of
    entries in formula, parameter, ifs, and lsystem files.

  Changes from 19.2 to 19.3 include:

  Added better math function error trapping for the formula parser. This
    can change the rendering of some PAR files using type=formula. If
    reset=1920 is included in the PAR file, the new error trapping is
    disabled.

  Fixed an old, rare, but nasty bug that stripped trailing zeros from the
    exponents of floating point numbers written to PAR files.

  Ctrl-ins and Ctrl-Del now change the browser frame colors.

  Fixed bug that occurred when writing PAR files containing a video= line
    with a four character video mode.

  Added batch facility to copy fractal information and color in GIFs to
    PAR format.

  Added current column to the &lt;tab&gt; screen.

  Removed support for reading Targa files.

  Added backwards compatibility for the fractal type fn(z*z).

  Added support for expanded and extended memory to the browser.  Use
    expanded memory if you don't have at least 4 MB of extended memory.

  Added pi and e to constants that the formula parser recognizes.  Fixed
    parser so that constants are recognized correctly.

  Added docs for freestyle mode in the colour editor.

  Fixed bug involving comments between formula entries.

  Allow renaming Fractint.exe without losing access to fractint's help
  files.

  Center-mag is now the default method for storing coordinates in PAR
  files.

  Increased limit on number of operations in a formula entry from 250 to
    over 2000. In most cases memory use is actually less than before
    because of use of existing memory arrays.

  Fixed a bug that caused the image to regenerate when the &lt;y&gt; screen was
    accessed, but nothing was changed (or color cycle range was changed).

  Fixed a bug that caused saved partial images that used logmap to use the
    incorrect logmap routine when restored (GIFs &amp; PARs).

  Made the solid guessing stop pass parameter save to GIFs and PARS.

  Added truecolor=yes command. This causes the iterations for each point
    to be written to a 24-bit Targa truecolor file called iterates.tga.
    Maxiter is also written to the file. This allows a simple outboard
    program to assign truecolors to iterations. Passes=1 is forced, but
    symmetry works.  (This function may go away in the future when real
    truecolor support is implemented.)

  Fixed bug that caused PARs to have incorrect number of parameters when a
    formula based GIF was loaded and a PAR made immediately.

  Added additional bailout tests manh and manr.  See Bailout Test (p. 98)
  .
  Fixed &lt;Z&gt; screen so bailout test can be changed when potential is being
  used.

  Fixed bug that caused large filename numbers to increment incorrectly.

  Added new guessing options g1, g2, etc. that cause guessing to terminate
    before the last pass.

  Added new orbitsave=sound option that causes orbits with sound on to
    write to a file sound.txt. The values written are the Hertz values for
    each orbit point. The time is written out in milliseconds once per
    pixel.

  Added documentation for making demm images to match ones made prior to
    version 16.

  Added key pressed check to autologmap so it is possible to bailout with
    a high maxit value.

  Made all floating point types capable of zooming out past (32,32).

  Added the formula parameters p1, p2, and p3 to the &lt;tab&gt; screen.

  Added stereo pair feature to stereo options menu.

  Fixed a bug that caused julia_inverse to continue after completed.

  Bignumber library rearranged. DOS midnight bug fix, so total time of
    images run overnight is now correct.

  Added logmap backwards compatibility for pre-version 19.2 images.

  Browser problem with flipped images fixed.

  Changed default corners to 4:3 aspect for types sierpinski, popcorn,
    pickover, popcornjul, tim's_error, martin, and halley.

  Added a range check for type=ants numants parameter.

  RDS save command is no longer case sensitive.

  Added the color number to the status area in the palette editor.

  Changed logmap and distest to a long variable to accomodate the version
    19.0 change to long maxit.

  Added a pixel-at-a-time routine to calculate the logmap values on the
    fly when memory is low or maxit &gt; 32767.  Use logmode=fly to use with
    maxit &lt; 32767.  Note: ranges still doesn't work with maxit &gt; 32767.

  Extended error checking to set the overflow variable when a zero
    denominator is found.  Added checking of overflow in a few places
    where it is needed.

  Added backwards compatibility for the old "broken" integer parser mod
    function.

  Fixed the maximum zoom out of the integer type fn(z*z) (and others) so
    the user doesn't get thrown out to DOS.

  Fixed writing of olddemmcolors variable to PAR file.

  Version 19.2 is a bug-fix release for version 19.1. Changes from 19.1 to
    19.2 include:

  Fixed the 3D function, which was broken in 19.1 due to a side-effect of
    a repair of a minor bug in 19.0. Arrgghh! This is the main reason for
    the release of this version so quickly.

  Fixed a bug that caused the Julia inverse window and the orbits window
    to lose their place after loading a color map.

  Fixed a bug that causes corners to be lost when too many digits are
  entered.

  Added an enhanced ants automaton by Luciano Genero and Fulvio Cappelli.

  New showorbit command allows orbits-during-generation feature to be
    turned on by default. Expanded limits of Hertz command to 20 to 15000.

  Targa 3D files are now correctly written to workdir rather than tempdir.

  Uncommented garbage between file entries is now ignored. (But note that
    "{" must be on same line as entry name.)

  Fixed savename update logic.

  Version 19.1 is a bug-fix release for version 19.0. Changes from 19.0 to
    19.1 include:

  Disabled the F6 (corners) key when in the parameters screen (&lt;z&gt;) for
    arbitrary precision.

  IFS formulas now show in &lt;z&gt; screen.

  Allow RDS image maps of arbitrary dimensions.

  Touched up Mandelbrot/Julia &lt;Space&gt; toggle logic.

  Fractint now remembers map name, and uses the mapfile path correctly,
    and now allows periods in directory names.

  Fixed tab bug that caused problems when interrupting a restore of an
    arbitrary precision image.

  Repaired savename logic. No longer show (usually truncated) full path of
    the saved file in the screen.

  Fixed double to arbitrary precision transition with 90 degree images.
    (This only failed before when the image was rotated exactly 90
    degrees.)

  Corrected docs directory errors that reported several commands such as
    PARDIR= that were not implemented. Documented the color cycling HOME
    function.

  Fixed Mandelbrot/Julia types with bailout less than 4 (try it, results
    are interesting!)

  Fixed browser delete feature which left a box on the screen after
    deleting and exiting browser feature.

  More changes in filename processing logic.  ".\" is now recognized as
    the current directory and is expanded to its full path name.  It is
    now possible, although not recommended, to designate the root
    directory of a disk as the desired search directory.

  Fixed integer math Mandelbrot bug for 286 or lower machines.

  Fixed problem of reading some Lsys files incorrectly (distribution
    PENROSE.L file was broken unless first line was commented.)

  Fixed problem that caused endless loop in RDS with bad input values.

  Made reading the current directory first optional, added the new
    curdir=yes command for times when you want to use current directory
    files.

  Fixed problem with complexpower() function ("x^y" formula operator) in
    the case where x == 0. (Note that formulas where 0^0 appears for every
    every pixel are considered broken and no promises made.)

  Prevented aspect ratio drift as you zoom. If you want to make tiny
    adjustments, use new ASPECTDRIFT=0 command.

  Inside=bof60 and bof61 options now work correctly with the formula
  parser.

  We discovered the calculation time is no good after 24 days, so instead
    of the time you will now get the message "A Really Long Time!!! (&gt;
    24.855 days)".  We thought you'd like to know ... A prize for the
    first person who actually *sees* this message!

  A summary of features new with 19.0 is as follows.

  New arbitrary precision math allows types mandelbrot, julia, manzpower,
    and julzpower to zoom to 10^1600. See Arbitrary Precision and Deep
    Zooming (p. 167)

  New Random Dot Stereogram feature using &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;S&gt;. Thanks to Paul De
    Leeuw for contributing this feature. For more, see Random Dot
    Stereograms (RDS) (p. 102).

  New browser invoked by the &lt;l&gt; command allows you to see the
    relationships of a family of images within the current corners values.
    See Browse Commands (p. 37) and Browser Parameters (p. 149). Thanks
    to Robin Bussell for contributing this feature.

  Added four bailout tests: real, imag, or, and.  These are set on the &lt;Z&gt;
    screen of the fractal types for which they work.  The default is still
    mod.  See Bailout Test (p. 98).

  New asin, asinh, acos, acosh, atan, atanh, sqrt, abs (abs(x)+i*abs(y)),
    and cabs (sqrt(x*x + y*y)) functions added to function variables and
    parser.

  New fractal types types chip, quadruptwo, threeply, phoenixcplx,
    mandphoenixclx, and ant automaton.

  Increased maximum iterations to 2,147,483,647 and maximum bailout to
    2,100,000,000 when using floating point math.

  New path/directory management. Fractint now remembers the pathname of
    command-line filenames. This means that you can specifiy directories
    where your files reside in SSTOOLS.INI. In what follows, &lt;path&gt; can be
    a directory, a filename, or a full path.

    File                      SSTOOLS.INI Command       Comments

    ==========================================================================
    PAR directory             parmfile=&lt;path&gt;
    GIF files for reading     filename=&lt;path&gt;
    MAP files                 map=&lt;path&gt;
    Autokey files             autokeyname=&lt;path&gt;
    GIF files for saving      savename=&lt;path&gt;
    Print file                printfile=&lt;path&gt;
    Formula files             formulafile=&lt;path&gt;
    Lsystem file              lfile=&lt;path&gt;
    IFS file                  ifsfile=&lt;path&gt;
    Miscellaneous files       workdir=&lt;path&gt;           new command
    Temporary files           tempdir=&lt;path&gt;           new command

    If the directories do not exist, Fractint gives an error message on
    runup with the option to continue.

  Fractint now searches all FRM, IFS, LSYS, and PAR files in the
    designated directory for entries. The number of entries in files has
    been greatly increased from 200 to 2000. Comment support in these
    files is improved.

  Parameters shown in &lt;z&gt; screen now match those used in a formula.

  Distance estimator logic has been overhauled, with the variable
    olddemmcolors added for backward compatibility.

  New floating point code for Lsystems from Nick Wilt greatly speeds up
     image generation.

  Enhanced fast parser from Chuck Ebbert makes floating point formula
    fractals faster than built-in types.

  Enhanced the history command to include all parameters, colors, and even
    .frm, .l, and .ifs file names and entries. Number of history sets
    remembered can be set with the maxhistory=&lt;nnn&gt; command to save
    memory.

  Enhanced center-mag coordinates to support rotated/stretched/skewed zoom
    boxes.

  Added new parameter to built-in Halley for comparison with formula type,
    also added new parameter to Frothybasin type.

  Added color number to orbits numbers &lt;n&gt; display.

  Added two new parameters to distest= to allow specifying resolution.
    This allows making resolution-independent distance estimator images.

  Fixed bug that caused the "big red switch" bug if '(' appeared in random
    uncommented formula file text, but fair warning, we don't officially
    support uncommented text in FRM files.

  Symmetry now works for the Marksjulia type and Marksmandel types.

  Full path no longer written in PAR files with &lt;b&gt; command.

  Fixed fractal type fn(z*z) so that zooming out will no longer dump you
    out to DOS, affecting zoomed out integer images made with this type.

  Fixed a float to fudged integer conversion that affects integer fractal
    types fn(z*z) and fn*fn.  This has only a minor impact on integer
    images made with these types.

  Default drive and directory restored after dropping to DOS, in case you
    changed it while under DOS.

  Added support for inversion to the formula parser (type=formula).

  Increased maximum number of files listed by &lt;r&gt; command to 2977 from
  300.

  Added outside=atan option.

  Added faster auto logmap logic.
