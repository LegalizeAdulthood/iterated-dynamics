  Version 16.12, 8/91

    Fix to cure some video problems reported with Amstrad 8088/8086-based
       PCs.

  Version 16.11, 7/91

    SuperVGA Autodetect fixed for older Tseng 3000 adapters.

    New "adapter=" options to force the selection of specific SuperVGA
       adapter types.  See Video Parameters (p. 134) for details.

    Integer/Floating-Point math toggle is changed only temporarily if
       floating-point math is forced due to deep zooming.

    Fractint now survives being modified by McAfee's "SCAN /AV" option.

    Bug Fixes for Acrospin interface, 3D "Light Source Before
       Transformation" fill type, and GIF decoder.

    New options in the &lt;Z&gt; parameters screen allow you to directly enter
       image coordinates.

    New "inside=zmag" and "outside=real|imag|mult|summ" options.

    The GIF Decoder now survives reading GIF files with a local color map.
    Improved IIT Math Coprocessor support.

    New color-cycling single-step options, '&lt;' and '&gt;'.

  Version 16.0, 6/91

    Integrated online help / fractint.doc system from Ethan Nagel.  To
      create a printable fractint.doc file see Startup Parameters (p. 122)
      .

    Over 350 screens of online help! Try pressing &lt;F1&gt; just about
    anywhere!

    New "autokey" feature.  Type "demo" to run the included demo.bat and
      demo.key files for a great demonstration of Fractint.  See Autokey
      Mode (p. 89) for details.

    New &lt;@&gt; command executes a saved set of commands.  The &lt;b&gt; command has
      changed to write the current image's parameters as a named set of
      commands in a structured file.  Saved sets of commands can
      subsequently be executed with the &lt;@&gt; command.  See Parameter
      Save/Restore Commands (p. 30).  A default "fractint.par" file is
      included with the release.

    New &lt;z&gt; command allows changing fractal type-specific parameters
      without going back through the &lt;t&gt; (fractal type selection) screen.

    Ray tracer interface from Marc Reinig, generates 3d transform output
      for a number of ray tracers; see "Interfacing with Ray Tracing
      Programs" (p. 117)

    Selection of video modes and structure of "fractint.cfg" have changed.
      If you have a customized fractint.cfg file, you'll have to rebuild
      it based on this release's version. You can customize the assignment
      of your favorite video modes to function keys; see Video Mode
      Function Keys (p. 36).  &lt;delete&gt; is a new command key which goes
      directly to video mode selection.

    New "cyclerange" option (command line and &lt;y&gt; options screen) from
      Hugh Steele. Limits color cycling to a specified range of colors.

    Improved Distance Estimator Method (p. 91) algorithm from Phil
    Wilson.

    New "ranges=" option from Norman Hills.  See Logarithmic Palettes and
      Color Ranges (p. 93) for details.

    type=formula definitions can use "variable functions" to select sin,
      cos, sinh, cosh, exp, log, etc at run time; new built-ins tan, tanh,
      cotan, cotanh, and flip are available with type=formula; see Type
      Formula (p. 65)

    New &lt;w&gt; command in palette editing mode to convert image to greyscale

    All "fn" fractal types (e.g. fn*fn) can now use new functions tan,
      tanh, cotan, cotanh, recip, and ident; bug in prior cos function
      fixed, new function cosxx (conjugate of cos) is the old erroneous
      cos calculation

    New L-Systems from Herb Savage
    New IFS types from Alex Matulich
    Many new formulas in fractint.frm, including a large group from JM
      Collard-Richard
    Generalized type manzpwr with complex exponent per Lee Skinner's
    request
    Initial orbit parameter added to Gingerbreadman fractal type

    New color maps (neon, royal, volcano, blues, headache) from Daniel
    Egnor

    IFS type has changed to use a single file containing named entries
      (instead of a separate xxx.ifs file per type); the &lt;z&gt; command
      brings up IFS editor (used to be &lt;i&gt; command).  See Barnsley IFS
      Fractals (p. 53).

    Much improved support for PaintJet printers; see PaintJet Parameters
    (p. 145)

    From Scott Taylor:
      Support for plotters using HP-GL; see Plotter Parameters (p. 146)
      Lots of new PostScript halftones; see PostScript Parameters (p. 143)
      "printer=PS[L]/0/..." for full page PostScript; see PostScript
      Parameters (p. 143)
      Option to drive printer ports directly (faster); see Printer
      Parameters (p. 142)
      Option to change printer end of line control chars; see Printer
      Parameters (p. 142)

    Support for XGA video adapter
    Support for Targa+ video adapter
    16 color VGA mode enhancements:
      Now use the first 16 colors of .map files to be more predictable
      Palette editor now works with these modes
      Color cycling now works properly with these modes Targa video
    adapter fixes; Fractint now uses (and requires) the "targa"
      and "targaset" environment variables for Targa systems
    "vesadetect=no" parameter to bypass use of VESA video driver; try
      this if you encounter video problems with a VESA driver Upgraded
    video adapter detect and handling from John Bridges; autodetect
      added for NCR, Trident 8900, Tseng 4000, Genoa (this code is from a
      beta release of VGAKIT, we're not sure it all works yet)

    Zoom box is included in saved/printed images (but, is not recognized
      as anything special when such an image is restored)

    The colors numbers reserved by the palette editor are now selectable
      with the new &lt;v&gt; palette editing mode command

    Option to use IIT floating point chip's special matrix arithmetic for
      faster 3D transforms; see "fpu=" in Startup Parameters (p. 122)

    Disk video cache increased to 64k; disk video does less seeking when
      running to real disk
    Faster floating point code for 287 and higher fpus, for types mandel,
      julia, barnsleyj1/m1/j2/m2, lambda, manowar, from Chuck Ebbert

    "filename=.xxx" can be used to set default &lt;r&gt; function file mask

    Selection of type formula or lsys now goes directly to entry selection
      (file selection step is now skipped); to change to a different file,
      use &lt;F6&gt; from the entry selection screen

    Three new values have been added to the textcolors= parameter; if you
      use this parameter you should update it by inserting values for the
      new 6th, 7th, 9th, and 13th positions; see "textcolors=" in Color
      Parameters (p. 128)

    The formula type's imag() function has changed to return the result as
      a real number

    Fractal type-specific parameters (entered after selecting a new
      fractal type with &lt;T&gt;) now restart at their default values each time
      you select a new fractal type

    Floating point input fields can now be entered in scientific notation
      (e.g.  11.234e-20). Entering the letters "e" and "p" in the first
      column causes the numbers e=2.71828... and pi=3.14159... to be
      entered.

    New option "orbitsave=yes" to create files for Acrospin for some types
      (see Barnsley IFS Fractals (p. 53), Orbit Fractals (p. 60),
      Acrospin (p. 203))

    Bug fixes:
      Problem with Hercules adapter auto-detection repaired.
      Problems with VESA video adapters repaired (we're not sure we've got
        them all yet...)
      3D transforms fixed to work at high resolutions (&gt; 1000 dots).
      3D parameters no longer clobbered when restoring non-3D images.
      L-Systems fixed to not crash when order too high for available
      memory.
      PostScript EPS file fixes.
      Bad leftmost pixels with floating point at 2048 dot resolution
      fixed.
      3D transforms fixed to use current &lt;x&gt; screen float/integer setting.
      Restore of images using inversion fixed.
      Error in "cos" function (used with "fn" type fractals) fixed; prior
        incorrect function still available as "cosxx" for compatibility

    Old 3D=nn/nn/nn/... form of 3D transform parameters no longer
    supported

    Fractint source code now Microsoft C6.00A compatible.
