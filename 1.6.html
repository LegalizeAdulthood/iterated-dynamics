 1.6 Image Save/Restore Commands

  &lt;S&gt; saves the current image to disk. All parameters required to recreate
  the image are saved with it. Progress is marked by colored lines moving
  down the screen's edges.

  The default filename for the first image saved after starting Fractint
  is FRACT001.GIF;  subsequent saves in the same session are automatically
  incremented 002, 003... Use the "savename=" parameter or &lt;X&gt; options
  screen to change the name. By default, files left over from previous
  sessions are not overwritten - the first unused FRACTnnn name is used.
  Use the "overwrite=yes" parameter or &lt;X&gt; options screen) to overwrite
  existing files.

  A save operation can be interrupted by pressing any key. If you
  interrupt, you'll be asked whether to keep or discard the partial file.

  &lt;R&gt; restores an image previously saved with &lt;S&gt;, or an ordinary GIF
  file.  After pressing &lt;R&gt; you are shown the file names in the current
  directory which match the current file mask. To select a file to
  restore, move the cursor to it (or type the first few letters of its
  name) and press &lt;Enter&gt;.

  Directories are shown in the file list with a "\" at the end of the
  name.  When you select a directory, the contents of that directory are
  shown. Or, you can type the name of a different directory (and
  optionally a different drive) and press &lt;Enter&gt; for a new display. You
  can also type a mask such as "*.XYZ" and press &lt;Enter&gt; to display files
  whose name ends with the matching suffix (XYZ).

  You can use &lt;F6&gt; to switch directories to the default fractint directory
  or to your own directory which is specified through the DOS environment
  variable "FRACTDIR".

  Once you have selected a file to restore, a summary description of the
  file is shown, with a video mode selection list. Usually you can just
  press &lt;Enter&gt; to go past this screen and load the image. Other choices
  available at this point are:
    Cursor keys: select a different video mode
    &lt;Tab&gt;: display more information about the fractal
    &lt;F1&gt;: for help about the "err" column in displayed video modes
  If you restore a file into a video mode which does not have the same
  pixel dimensions as the file, Fractint will make some adjustments:  The
  view window parameters (see &lt;V&gt; command) will automatically be set to an
  appropriate size, and if the image is larger than the screen dimensions,
  it will be reduced by using only every Nth pixel during the restore.
