 2.44 Mandelcloud

  (type=mandelcloud)

  This fractal computes the Mandelbrot function, but displays it
  differently.  It starts with regularly spaced initial pixels and
  displays the resulting orbits.  This idea is somewhat similar to the
  Dynamic System (p. 75).

  There are two options that have unusual effects on this fractal.  The
  Orbit Delay value controls how many initial points are computed before
  the orbits are displayed on the screen.  This allows the orbit to settle
  down.  The outside=summ option causes each pixel to increment color
  every time an orbit touches it; the resulting display is a 2-d
  histogram.

  This fractal was invented by Noel Giffin.
