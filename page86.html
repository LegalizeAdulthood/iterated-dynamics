 3. Doodads, Bells, and Whistles


 3.1 Drawing Method

  The "passes option" (&lt;X&gt; options screen or "passes=" parameter) selects
  one of the single-pass, dual-pass, triple-pass, solid-guessing
  (default), solid-guessing after pass n, boundary tracing, tesseral,
  synchronous orbits, or orbits modes.

  This option applies to most fractal types.

  Single-pass mode ("1") draws the screen pixel by pixel.

  Dual-pass ("2") generates a half-resolution screen first as a preview
  using 2x2-pixel boxes, and then generates the rest of the dots with a
  second pass. Dual-pass uses no more time than single-pass.

  Triple-pass ("3") generates the coarse first pass of the solidguessing
  mode (see "g" below), then switches to either "1" (with low resolution
  video modes) or "2" (with higher resolution video modes). The advantage
  of '3' vs '2' is that when using high resolution modes, the first pass
  has a much lower resolution (about 160x120) and is therefore much
  quicker than the first pass of the passes=2 mode. However, with the '2'
  mode, the first pass does not represent wasted time. The '3' mode wastes
  the effort of generating the coarse first screen.

  The single, dual, and triple pass modes all result in identical images.
  These modes are for those who desire the highest possible accuracy. Most
  people will want to use the guessing mode, described next.

  Solid-guessing ("g") is the default.  It performs from two to four
  visible passes - more in higher resolution video modes. Its first
  visible pass is actually two passes - one pixel per 4x4, 8x8, or 16x16
  pixel box is generated, and the guessing logic is applied to fill in the
  blocks at the next level (2x2, 4x4, or 8x8).  Subsequent passes fill in
  the display at the next finer resolution, skipping blocks which are
  surrounded by the same color. Solid-guessing can guess wrong, but it
  sure guesses quickly!

  Solid-guessing stop after pass n ("g1" through "g6") are a variation on
  the guessing mode in which the algorithm stops after the nth pass. This
  facility is for exploring in low resolution when you'd rather see a low
  resolution image with large blocky pixels filling the whole screen than
  a small low resolution image such as you get with the &lt;v&gt; (View Windows)
  command. Note that on the &lt;x&gt; screen you can't directly type g1 or g2.
  Press g repeatedly until you get the option you want, or else use the
  left or right cursor keys.

  Boundary Tracing ("b"), which only works accurately with fractal types
  (such as the Mandelbrot set, but not the Newton type) that do not
  contain "islands" of colors, finds a color boundary, traces it around
  the screen, and then "blits" in the color over the enclosed area.
