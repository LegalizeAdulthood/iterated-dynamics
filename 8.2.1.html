 8.2.1 Periodicity Logic

  The "Mandelbrot Lake" in the center of the M-set images is the
  traditional bane of plotting programs. It sucks up the most computer
  time because it always reaches the iteration limit -- and yet the most
  interesting areas are invariably right at the edge the lake.  (See The
  Mandelbrot Set (p. 43) for a description of the iteration process.)

  Thanks to Mark Peterson for pointing out (well, he more like beat us
  over the head until we paid attention) that the iteration values in the
  middle of Mandelbrot Lake tend to decay to periodic loops (i.e., Z(n+m)
  == Z(n), a fact that is pointed out on pages 58-61 of "The Beauty of
  Fractals"). An intelligent program (like the one he wrote) would check
  for this periodicity once in a while, recognize that iterations caught
  in a loop are going to max out, and bail out early.

  For speed purposes, the current version of the program turns this
  checking algorithm on only if the last pixel generated was in the lake.
  (The checking itself takes a small amount of time, and the pixels on the
  very edge of the lake tend to decay to periodic loops very slowly, so
  this compromise turned out to be the fastest generic answer).

  Try a full M-set plot with a 1000-iteration maximum with any other
  program, and then try it on this one for a pretty dramatic proof of the
  value of periodicity checking.

  You can get a visual display of the periodicity effects if you press
  &lt;O&gt;rbits while plotting. This toggles display of the intermediate
  iterations during the generation process.  It also gives you an idea of
  how much work your poor little PC is going through for you!  If you use
  this toggle, it's best to disable solid-guessing first using &lt;1&gt; or &lt;2&gt;
  because in its second pass, solid-guessing bypasses many of the pixel
  calculations precisely where the orbits are most interesting.

  Mark was also responsible for pointing out that 16-bit integer math was
  good enough for the first few levels of M/J images, where the round-off
  errors stay well within the area covered by a single pixel. Fractint now
  uses 16-bit math where applicable, which makes a big difference on non-
  32-bit PCs.
