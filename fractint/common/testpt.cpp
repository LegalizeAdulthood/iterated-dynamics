// Write your fractal program here. initreal and initimag are the values in
// the complex plane; parm1, and parm2 are paramaters to be entered with the
// "params=" option (if needed). The function should return the color associated
// with initreal and initimag.  Iterated Dynamics will repeatedly call your function with
// the values of initreal and initimag ranging over the rectangle defined by the
// "corners=" option. Assuming your formula is iterative, "g_max_iteration" is the maximum
// iteration. If "g_max_iteration" is hit, color "inside" should be returned.
//
// Note that this routine could be sped up using external variables/arrays
// rather than the current parameter-passing scheme.  The goal, however was
// to make it as easy as possible to add fractal types, and this looked like
// the easiest way.
//
// This module is part of an overlay, with calcfrac.cpp.  The routines in it
// must not be called by any part of Iterated Dynamics other than calcfrac.
//
// The sample code below is a straightforward Mandelbrot routine.

// this routine is called once for every pixel
