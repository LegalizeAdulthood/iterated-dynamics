FRACTINT:
Fractint 20.4 complete C and ASM source for
the DOS-based fractal generator. Requires
Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 or later or Borland C/C++
3.1 or later. Object code of ASM modules 
supplied so an assembler is not required.

Note that the Borland project files are in the extra directory
and have not been updated to use the new source tree structure.

Copyrighted freeware.

XFRACTINT:
Download the source tarball (for example: xfract20.3.02.tar.gz), put it in
your home directory, and untar it with the command:

tar -xzf xfract20.3.02.tar.gz

This will create the directory xfractint-20.03p02 containing the source.
You might want to change the directory name to xfractint for convenience.

You will need to have gcc, ncurses, and ncurse-develop installed.  You also
need the XFree86-libs package installed for the X11 libraries.  This package
should already be installed, but if it isn't and your distribution doesn't
have it, then you need the XFree86-devel package.

The Makefile is set up for my convenience, so if you want to put files in
different directories, you will need to change the SRCDIR setting.  
Otherwise, just run "make" from the source directory and it should compile.  
Run ./xfractint to start it up.  Or, run "make install" to be able to run
xfractint from anywhere.
