Alpha 1:
==========================================================================
-  Closing the window upon exit:
    <esc> <y> always seems to work (DOS compatible)
   The upper right corner button works sometimes - but usually not after 
   completing a fractal.
   Sometimes the screen clears to white but the window frame remains.

- Orbits window crashes - probably because you don't do this in disk 
video mode. :-)

- Viewwindows screen doesn't bring up any parameters.

I notice that you have true-color modes in the Select Video Mode page, 
but FractInt doesn't have the ability to handle these yet, does it?

Slideshow stuff is all messed up.  Works partially, but when we're blocked
on Windows waiting for an event, we need a way to timeout and return to the
slideshow.  Could use a SetTimer if we knew the time from the slideshow
code.  The old slideshow code did a busy wait polling for keyboard input,
where the slideshow would have a chance to inject a key if enough time
went by.

Computed image doesn't save right.  The encoder code uses extraseg, that
could be the problem.  Therefore, there's no way to know if the image
is computed properly yet.

INSERT doesn't reset g_text_rbase and g_text_cbase or something.
