This file describes known issues in this release, from oldest to newest:

There is no mouse support.  Zooming is by keyboard only.

Video modes with pixel dimensions other than 4/3 aspect ratio assume
non-square pixels.  The images all render fine, but they appear stretched
or squashed.

With debugflag=10000, error messages are reported for disk video mode when:
start fractint, pick any disk video mode (e.g. 320x200),
let it render, wait for completion, then go to the <v> screen,
change 320 to 32, submit it.  This problem is present in the DOS fractint.

start fractint, pick a video mode > 320x200, render mandelbrot,
go to the <v> screen, "Preview display?" -> "yes", <Enter>,
so far OK, then again <v>, (change nothing), <Enter>
-> fractint window resized to 320x200
