Alpha 1:
==========================================================================
-  Closing the window upon exit:
    <esc> <y> always seems to work (DOS compatible)
   The upper right corner button works sometimes - but usually not after 
   completing a fractal.
   Sometimes the screen clears to white but the window frame remains.

-----

Slideshow stuff is all messed up.  Works partially, but when we're blocked
on Windows waiting for an event, we need a way to timeout and return to the
slideshow.  Could use a SetTimer if we knew the time from the slideshow
code.  The old slideshow code did a busy wait polling for keyboard input,
where the slideshow would have a chance to inject a key if enough time
went by.

INSERT doesn't reset g_text_rbase and g_text_cbase or something.

Beta 1
==========================================================================
After zooming around for a little while with PAGEUP, things get confused
and it no longer renders new images and the zoom box is not erased.

There is some funniness when switching between video modes sometimes.

3.  Restore of image in a different (or maybe just larger?) resolution 
than the current video made causes Frac4Win to crash.

3. More on trying to restore - an error message states:

The following files will be included in this error report:
C:\DOCUME~1\Lee\LOCALS~1\Temp\6a3a_appcompat.txt

But this file does not exist!

also, Ctrl^Pad+ and Ctrl^Pad- zoombox
rotation doesn't work..

mouse is not supposed to work yet, right?

and those double-height video modes,
as far as i can recall, there's some pixel
aspect ratio variable burried somewhere..

..wouldn't it be nice if one could specify
the canvas size directly, say, at the view
window prompt screen? (..well, later..)

I) started fractint, selected a non-disk video, rendered mandel, so far OK..
-- then restarted using <Ins>, selected a disk-video mode -> blank screen
(although it seems to respond to keyboard input, it doesn't display anything)
..while selecting a non-disk video after an <Ins> restart is OK..

II) started fractint, selected a disk-video mode, "rendered" mandel, OK so far..
-- on completion, went to the "View Window Options" screen (<v>), lessened
dimensions, submitted -> fractint crashed (most of the time)

III) started fractint, selected a mode like 8-8-8, or 1280x1024 (formerly VESA),
-- went to the "View Window Options" screen (<v>), changed nothing, submit
-> "insufficient free memory/disk space" ... reason:

VESA virtual screen setup is here in effect, trying to figure out the size of the
video memory -- of course it fails, in win32 environment.. so untill someone
implements a win32 fullscreen mode AND a win32 virtual screen setup,
there is no use for virtual screens in a windowed context and i suggest
turning it off (e.g. make "virtual=n" a default setting)

In the <m> screen, 
if you press the down arrow until it stops, the menu items
orbits window   <o> (left side near top) and the 
stereogram   <ctrl-s> (right side at bottom)
duplicate themselves.  (in Win32 Disk Video 800x600)

The R00/G00/B00 text in the palette editor doesn't display properly.
