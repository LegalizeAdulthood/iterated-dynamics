 Appendix F Other Programs

  FDESIGN, by Doug Nelson (CIS ID 70431,3374) - a freeware IFS fractal
  generator available from CompuServe in DIGART LIB 9, and probably on
  your local BBS.  This program requires a VGA adapter and a Microsoft-
  compatible mouse, and a floating point coprocessor is highly
  recommended.  It generates IFS fractals in a *much* more intuitive
  fashion than Fractint.  It can also (beginning with version 3.0) save
  its IFS formulas in Fractint-style .IFS files.

  BRAZIL Fractal Generator by David CHARDONNET - A freeware IFS fractal
  generator and animator for Windows 95 and Win/NT 4.0 shares common
  fractal description language for sharing fractals between fractint and
  this program.  It can be downloaded from his website:
     http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/1837/index_a.html

  FRACTINT SCREEN SAVER by Thore Berntsen. This freeware screen saver
  works with Fractint. Check this out at:
     http://home.sol.no/~thbernt/fintsave.htm

  The following pieces of software are pretty old now, but for now these
  references are still here. Winfract is based on on old version of
  Fractint and is no longer maintained.

  WINFRACT. Bert Tyler has ported Fractint to run under Windows 3.  The
  same underlying code is used, with a Windows user interface.  Winfract
  has almost all the functionality of Fractint - the biggest difference is
  the absence of a zillion weird video modes.  Fractint for DOS will
  continue to be the definitive version.  Winfract is available from
  CompuServe in DIGART LIB 9, as WINFRA.ZIP (executable) and WINSRC.ZIP
  (source).

  PICLAB, by Lee Crocker - a freeware image manipulation utility available
  from CompuServe in PICS Lib 10, as PICLAB.EXE.  PICLAB can do very
  sophisticated resizing and color manipulation of GIF and TGA files.  It
  can be used to reduce 24 bit TGA files generated with the Fractint
  "lightname" option to GIF files.

  ACROSPIN, by David Parker - An inexpensive commercial program that reads
  an object definition file and creates images that can be rapidly rotated
  in three dimensions. The Fractint "orbitsave=yes" option creates files
  that this program can read for orbit-type fractals and IFS fractals.
