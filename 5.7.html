 5.7 Fractal Type Parameters

  TYPE=[name]
  Selects the fractal type to calculate. The default is type "mandel".

  PARAMS=n/n/n/n...
  Set optional (required, for some fractal types) values used in the
  calculations. These numbers typically represent the real and imaginary
  portions of some startup value, and are described in detail as needed in
  Fractal Types (p. 43).
  (Example: FRACTINT TYPE=julia PARAMS=-0.48/0.626 would wait at the
  opening screen for you to select a video mode, but then proceed straight
  to the Julia set for the stated x (real) and y (imaginary) coordinates.)

  FUNCTION=[fn1[/fn2[/fn3[/fn4]]]]
  Allows setting variable functions found in some fractal type formulae.
  Possible values are sin, cos, tan, cotan, sinh, cosh, tanh, cotanh, exp,
  log, sqr, recip (i.e. 1/z), ident (i.e. identity), cosxx (cos with a pre
  version 16 bug), flip, zero, one, asin, asinh, acos, acosh, atan, atanh,
  sqrt, abs (abs(x)+i*abs(y)), cabs (sqrt(x*x+y*y)). New additions are the
  various rounding-to-integer functions: floor (round down), ceil (round
  up), trunc (round toward zero), and round (round to nearest).

  FORMULANAME=[formulaname]
  Specifies the default formula name for type=formula fractals.  (I.e. the
  name of a formula defined in the FORMULAFILE.) Required if you want to
  generate one of these fractal types in batch mode, as this is the only
  way to specify a formula name in that case.

  LNAME=[lsystemname]
  Specifies the default L-System name. (I.e. the name of an entry in the
  LFILE.) Required if you want to generate one of these fractal types in
  batch mode, as this is the only way to specify an L-System name in that
  case.

  IFS=[ifsname]
  Specifies the default IFS name. (I.e. the name of an entry in the
  IFSFILE.) Required if you want to generate one of these fractal types in
  batch mode, as this is the only way to specify an IFS name in that case.
