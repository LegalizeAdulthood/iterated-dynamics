 7. Common Problems

  Of course, Fractint would never stoop to having a "common" problem.
  These notes describe some, ahem, "special situations" which come up
  occasionally and which even we haven't the gall to label as "features".

  Fractint (alas!) is still a DOS program. It runs well under windows, but
  there can be problems. Here are some tips from some expert users.

  Jay Hill's Windows tips:
    For starters, make sure the DOS window properties are set to 'Misc |
    Always suspend' = off." Unless you want the task to stop when it does
    not have focus. Also, you can put the Idle Sensitivity to high. Make
    settings on any other DOS windows you have open according to what they
    should be (or what you prefer).

    If your DOS window is full screen, press Alt-Enter to make it a Window
    window.  Then click on the MSDOS icon in the upper left. WARNING,
    don't do this in a high res graphics mode or in text mode (sometimes).
    The safest is F3 320x200 graphics mode. Windows likes that mode. If
    you have a high res image, hit 'X' to get the text screen and then
    Alt-ENTER to get the DOS Windows window...  POW...your task will
    likely die. So ... don't do that:

    Some DOS programs eat up to 50% or 80% CPU time just sitting watching
    for key strokes. Clearly, these should be suspended when they don't
    have the focus. A simple DOS prompt, I have found, eats little time.

    Some web pages eat lots of time (watching prompt boxes) while others
    eat little (plain text or graphics with no links).

    It has been noted here before, you can make a shortcut to Fractint.exe
    and tailor its properties. I use in the program tab: command line:

    FRACTINT.EXE textsafe=save sound=off

    Under the screen tab: Usage: Full screen.  Under Misc: Allow screen
    saver=off.

    You should coordinate your DOS windows according to what you are
    doing.  I often change the settings for a short time, just to do some
    other task.

  Damien M. Jones Windows tips:
    This is what works for me. Your mileage may vary.

    Create a shortcut to FRACTINT.EXE, right-click it, choose Properties.
    On the Memory tab: set all five drop-downs to "Auto".  On the Screen
    tab: choose Full-screen and Fast ROM emulation, leave Dynamic memory
    allocation OFF.  Under the Misc tab: turn OFF Allow screen saver. Turn
    ON Always suspend.  Set the Idle sensitivity to about 1/4, closest to
    Low.

    In the SSTOOLS.INI file, put textsafe=save on a line by itself in the
    [fractint] section. (This helps preserve your screen when you switch
    away from FractInt, but only works if Always suspend is turned ON.)
