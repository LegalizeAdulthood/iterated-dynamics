  Fractint has a number of types of compressed palette, selected by the
  "Log Palette" line on the &lt;X&gt; screen, or by the "logmap=" command line
  parameter:

    logmap=1: for standard logarithmic palette.

    logmap=-1: "old" logarithmic palette. This variant was the only one
    used before Fractint 14.0. It differs from logmap=1 in that some
    colors are not used - logmap=1 "spreads" low color numbers which are
    unused by logmap=-1's pure logarithmic mapping so that all colors are
    assigned.

    logmap=N (&gt;1): Same as logmap=1, but starting from iteration count N.
    Pixels with iteration counts less than N are mapped to color 1. This
    is useful when zooming in an area near the lake where no points in the
    image have low iteration counts - it makes use of the low colors which
    would otherwise be unused.

    logmap=-N (&lt;-1): Similar to logmap=N, but uses a square root
    distribution of the colors instead of a logarithmic one.

    logmap=2 or -2: Auto calculates the logmap value for maximum effect.

  Another way to change the 1:1 mapping of iteration counts to colors is
  to use the "RANGES=" parameter.  It has the format:
     RANGES=aa/bb/cc/dd/...

  Iteration counts up to and including the first value are mapped to color
  number 0, up to and including the second value to color number 1, and so
  on. The values must be in ascending order.

  A negative value can be specified for "striping". The negative value
  specifies a stripe width, the value following it specifies the limit of
  the striped range.  Two alternating colors are used within the striped
  range.

  Example:   RANGES=0/10/30/-5/65/79/32000
  This example maps iteration counts to colors as follows:

      color    iterations
      -------------------
        0      unused (formula always iterates at least once)
        1       1 to 10
        2      11 to 30
        3      31 to 35, 41 to 45, 51 to 55, and 61 to 65
        4      36 to 40, 46 to 50, and 56 to 60
        5      66 to 79
        6      80 and greater
  Note that the maximum value in a RANGES parameter is 32767 and the
  maximum value for the number of iterations is also 32767 when using
  RANGES.
