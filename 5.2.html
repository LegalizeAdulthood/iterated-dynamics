 5.2 Setting Defaults (SSTOOLS.INI File)

  Every time Fractint runs, it searches the current directory, and then
  the directories in your DOS PATH, for a file named SSTOOLS.INI.  If it
  finds this file, it begins by reading parameters from it.  This file is
  useful for setting parameters you always want, such as those defining
  your printer setup.

  SSTOOLS.INI is divided into sections belonging to particular programs.
  Each section begins with a label in brackets. Fractint looks for the
  label [fractint], and ignores any lines it finds in the file belonging
  to any other label. If an SSTOOLS.INI file looks like this:

    [fractint]
    sound=off      ; (for home use only)
    printer=hp     ; my printer is a LaserJet
    inside=0       ; using "traditional" black
    [startrek]
    warp=9.5       ; Captain, I dinna think the engines can take it!

  Fractint will use only the second, third, and fourth lines of the file.
  (Why use a convention like that when Fractint is the only program you
  know of that uses an SSTOOLS.INI file?  Because there are other programs
  (such as Lee Crocker's PICLAB) that now use the same file, and there may
  one day be other, sister programs to Fractint using that file.)
