 New Features in 20.4.X

  This is a developer's "incremental" release. These incremental releases
  typically have a short life and are updated frequently. They may have
  bug fixes, and thus be more stable, but they may also have new features
  which very likely have new bugs.

  Version 20.4.5 is an update of Fractint 20.0 based on the developer's
    version 20.4.4.  New features include:

  Patch 5 to Version 20.4.0

  Tim's changes (5/29/2006)
    Moved version 20.0 change history to revision history to make room for
    in help.src.

    Changed help screen to show just two main authors - decided better not
    to show inactive authors.

    Removed commented out complex macros in fractals.c.

    Added commented out bf version of Mandelbrot in fractalp.c. Giving
    thought to offerring bfmath as an option to bnmath, but if we fix the
    current bignum problems, this may be moot.

    Added interation to &lt;tab&gt; screen.

  Jonathan's changes
    Fixed the logic for calculating when to switch from using a grid to
    using the on-the-fly calculation of an image's pixels.  The logic was
    not handling disk video images sized above 2048x2048 with floating
    point enabled.

    Added the savename to the disk video status screen.

    Fixed bug in the compare routine of bn_math that fixes long standing
    problem with periodicity checking in deep zoomed images.

    Resurrected the documentation for ap_math that was at the beginning of
    bignum.c.

  Patch 4 to Version 20.4.0
  Added minor changes so that Xfractint would compile under Cygwin.

    Added lines to the Xfractint makefile (commented out) for compiling in
    a 64-bit environment.

    Fixed Xfractint so that built in calls to a different map file would
    work.

    Modified the logic for calculating when to switch from using a grid to
    using the on-the-fly calculation of an image's pixels.  This affects
    how large an image can be made when using integer math.  The switch is
    now made when (xdots + ydots) * sizeof(long) &gt; 32768.
