 1.5 Palette Editing Commands

  Palette-editing mode provides a number of tools for modifying the colors
  in an image.  It can be used only with MCGA or higher adapters, and only
  with 16 or 256 color video modes.  Many thanks to Ethan Nagel for
  creating the palette editor.

  Use the &lt;E&gt; key to enter palette-editing mode from a displayed image or
  from the main menu.

  When this mode is entered, an empty palette frame is displayed. You can
  use the cursor keys to position the frame outline, and &lt;Pageup&gt; and
  &lt;Pagedn&gt; to change its size.  (The upper and lower limits on the size
  depend on the current video mode.)  When the frame is positioned where
  you want it, hit Enter to display the current palette in the frame.

  Note that the palette frame shows R(ed) G(reen) and B(lue) values for
  two color registers at the top.  The active color register has a solid
  frame, the inactive register's frame is dotted.  Within the active
  register, the active color component is framed.

  With a video mode of 640x400 or higher, a status area appears between
  the two color registers.  This status area shows:

    nnn  = color number at the cursor location
    A    = Auto mode
    X, Y = exclusion modes
    F    = freesyle mode
    T    = stripe mode is waiting for #

  Using the commands described below, you can assign particular colors to
  the registers and manipulate them.  Note that at any given time there
  are two colors "X"d - these are pre-empted by the editor to display the
  palette frame. They can be edited but the results won't be visible. You
  can change which two colors are borrowed ("X"d out) by using the &lt;v&gt;
  command.

  Once the palette frame is displayed and filled in, the following
  commands are available:

  &lt;F1&gt;
  Bring up a HELP screen with commands specific to palette-editing mode.

  &lt;Esc&gt;
  Leave palette-editing mode

  &lt;H&gt;
  Hide the palette frame to see full image; the cross-hair remains visible
  and all functions remain enabled; hit &lt;H&gt; again to restore the palette
  display.

  Cursor keys
  Move the cross-hair cursor around. In 'auto' mode (the default) the
  color under the center of the cross-hair is automatically assigned to
  the active color register. Control-Cursor keys move the cross-hair
  faster. A mouse can also be used to move around.

  &lt;R&gt; &lt;G&gt; &lt;B&gt;
  Select the Red, Green, or Blue component of the active color register
  for subsequent commands

  &lt;Insert&gt; &lt;Delete&gt;
  Select previous or next color component in active register

  &lt;+&gt; &lt;-&gt;
  Increase or decrease the active color component value by 1  Numeric
  keypad (gray) + and - keys do the same.

  &lt;Pageup&gt; &lt;Pagedn&gt;
  Increase or decrease the active color component value by 5; Moving the
  mouse up/down with left button held is the same

  &lt;0&gt; &lt;1&gt; &lt;2&gt; &lt;3&gt; &lt;4&gt; &lt;5&gt; &lt;6&gt;
  Set the active color component's value to 0 10 20 ... 60

  &lt;Space&gt;
  Select the other color register as the active one.  In the default
  'auto' mode this results in the now-inactive register being set to
  remember the color under the cursor, and the now-active register
  changing from whatever it had previously remembered to now follow the
  color.

  &lt;,&gt; &lt;.&gt;
  Rotate the palette one step.  By default colors 1 through 255 inclusive
  are rotated.  This range can be over-ridden with the "cyclerange"
  parameter, the &lt;Y&gt; options screen, or the &lt;O&gt; command described below.

  "&lt;" "&gt;"
  Rotate the palette continuously (until next keystroke)

  &lt;O&gt;
  Set the color cycling range to the range of colors currently defined by
  the color registers.

  &lt;C&gt;
  Enter Color-Cycling Mode.  When you invoke color-cycling from here, it
  will subsequently return to palette-editing when you &lt;Esc&gt; from it.  See
  Color Cycling Commands (p. 23).

  &lt;=&gt;
  Create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the colors selected by
  the two color registers.

  &lt;M&gt;
  Specify a gamma value for the shading created by &lt;=&gt;.

  &lt;D&gt;
  Duplicate the inactive color register's values to the active color
  register.

  &lt;T&gt;
  Stripe-shade - create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the two
  color registers, setting only every Nth register.  After hitting &lt;T&gt;,
  hit a numeric key from 2 to 9 to specify N.  For example, if you press
  &lt;T&gt; &lt;3&gt;, smooth shading is done between the two color registers,
  affecting only every 3rd color between them.  The other colors between
  them remain unchanged.

  &lt;W&gt;
  Convert current palette to gray-scale.  (If the &lt;X&gt; or &lt;Y&gt; exclude
  ranges described later are in force, only the active range of colors is
  converted to gray-scale.)

  &lt;Shift-F2&gt; ... &lt;Shift-F9&gt;
  Store the current palette in a temporary save area associated with the
  function key.  The temporary save palettes are useful for quickly
  comparing different palettes or the effect of some changes - see next
  command.  The temporary palettes are only remembered until you exit from
  palette-editing mode.
  Starting with version 19.6, when palette editing mode is entered, the
  original palette is stored in the area associated with F2.

  &lt;F2&gt; ... &lt;F9&gt;
  Restore the palette from a temporary save area.  If you haven't
  previously saved a palette for the function key, you'll get a simple
  grey scale.

  &lt;L&gt;
  Pause and load an external color map (.MAP file).  See Palette Maps
  (p. 88).

  &lt;S&gt;
  Pause, prompt for a filename, and save the current palette to the named
  file (.MAP assumed).  See Palette Maps (p. 88).

  &lt;I&gt;
  Invert frame colors.  With some colors the palette is easier to see when
  the frame colors are interchanged.

  &lt;\&gt;
  Move or resize the palette frame.  The frame outline is drawn - it can
  then be repositioned and sized with the cursor keys, &lt;Pageup&gt; and
  &lt;Pagedn&gt;, just as was done when first entering palette-editing mode.
  Hit Enter when done moving/sizing.

  &lt;V&gt;
  Use the colors currently selected by the two color registers for the
  palette editor's frame.  When palette editing mode is entered, the last
  two colors are "X"d out for use by the palette editor; this command can
  be used to replace the default with two other color numbers.

  &lt;A&gt;
  Toggle 'auto' mode on or off.  When on (the default), the active color
  register follows the cursor; when off, &lt;Enter&gt; must be pressed to set
  the active register to the color under the cursor.

  &lt;Enter&gt;
  Only useful when 'auto' is off, as described above; double clicking the
  left mouse button is the same as Enter.

  &lt;X&gt;
  Toggle 'exclude' mode on or off - when toggled on, only those image
  pixels which match the active color are displayed.

  &lt;Y&gt;
  Toggle 'exclude' range on or off - similar to &lt;X&gt;, but all pixels
  matching colors in the range of the two color registers are displayed.

  &lt;N&gt;
  Make a negative color palette - will convert only current color if in
  'x' mode or range between editors in 'y' mode or entire palette if in
  "normal" mode.

  &lt;!&gt;
  &lt;@&gt;     &lt;"&gt;       (English keyboard)  &lt;u-grave&gt; (French keyboard)
  &lt;#&gt;  &lt;pound sign&gt; (English keyboard)     &lt;$&gt;    (French keyboard)
  Swap R&lt;-&gt;G, G&lt;-&gt;B, and R&lt;-&gt;B columns. &lt;!&gt;, &lt;@&gt;, and &lt;#&gt; are shifted 1,
  2, and 3, which you may find easier to remember.

  &lt;U&gt;
  Undoes the last palette editor command.  Will undo all the way to the
  beginning of the current session.

  &lt;E&gt;
  Redoes the undone palette editor commands.

  &lt;F&gt;
  Toggles "Freestyle mode" on and off (Freestyle mode changes a range of
  palette values smoothly from a center value outward).  With your cursor
  inside the palette box, press the &lt;F&gt; key to enter Freestyle mode.  A
  default range of colors will be selected for you centered at the cursor
  (the ends of the color range are noted by putting dashed lines around
  the corresponding palette values). While in Freestyle mode:

   Moving the mouse changes the location of the range of colors that are
   affected.

   Control-Insert/Delete or the shifted-right-mouse-button changes the
   size of the affected palette range.

   The normal color editing keys (R,G,B,1-6, etc) set the central color of
   the affected palette range.

   Pressing ENTER or double-clicking the left mouse button makes the
   palette changes permanent (if you don't perform this step, any palette
   changes disappear when you press the &lt;F&gt; key again to exit freestyle
   mode).
