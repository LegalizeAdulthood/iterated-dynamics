 2.7 Complex Newton

  (type=complexnewton/complexbasin)

  Well, hey, "Z^n - 1" is so boring when you can use "Z^a - b" where "a"
  and "b" are complex numbers!  The new "complexnewton" and "complexbasin"
  fractal types are just the old "newton" (p. 48) and "newtbasin"
  (p. 47) fractal types with this little added twist.  When you select
  these fractal types, you are prompted for four values (the real and
  imaginary portions of "a" and "b").  If "a" has a complex portion, the
  fractal has a discontinuity along the negative axis - relax, we finally
  figured out that it's *supposed* to be there!
