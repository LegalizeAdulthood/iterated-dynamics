 5.5 Startup Parameters

  @FILENAME
  Causes Fractint to read "filename" for parameters. When it finishes, it
  resumes reading its own command line -- i.e., "FRACTINT MAXITER=250
  @MYFILE PASSES=1" is legal. This option is only valid on the DOS command
  line, as Fractint is not clever enough to deal with multiple
  indirection.

  @FILENAME/GROUPNAME
  Like @FILENAME, but reads a named group of parameters from a parameter
  file.  See "Parameter Files and the &lt;@&gt; Command" (p. 121).

  TEMPDIR=[directory]
  This command allows to specify the directory where Fractint writes
  temporary files.

  WORKDIR=[directory]
  This command sets the directory where miscellaneous Fractint files get
  written, including MAKEMIG.BAT and debugging files.

  FILENAME=[name]
  Causes Fractint to read the named file, which must either have been
  saved from an earlier Fractint session or be a generic GIF file, and use
  that as the starting point, bypassing the initial information screens.
  The filetype is optional and defaults to .GIF. Non-Fractint GIF files
  are restored as fractal type "plasma".

  On the DOS command line you may omit FILENAME= and just give the file
  name.

  CURDIR=yes
  Fractint uses directories set by various commands, possibly in the
  SSTOOLS.INI file. If you want to try out some files in the current
  directory, such as a modified copy of FRACTINT.FRM, you won't Fractint
  to read the copy in your official FRM directory. Setting curdir=yes at
  the command line will cause Fractint to look in the current directory
  for requested files first before looking in the default directory set by
  the other commands. Warning: &lt;tab&gt; screen may not reflect actual file
  opened in cases where the file was opened in the DOS current directory.

  MAKEPAR=parfile/entryname
  This command invokes a batch facility to copy fractal and color
  information stored in GIF files to PAR format. The syntax is:
       fractint filename.gif makepar=parfile.par/entryname &gt;&gt; makepar.log
  The entryname is optional and defaults to the name of the gif filename
  if absent. Other parameters can appear before the makepar= command, but
  anything after will ignored. If the parfile and entryname exist, the
  entry will replace the previous entry. If the entry doesn't exist, it
  will be added. If the parfile doesn't exist it will be created.
  Redirection of output to a log file is possible in the DOS version
  because all screen output is written to the standard output.

  If you leave the GIF filename out of the command lime but add a map=
  command, then the makepar command will write a PAR named for the color
  map with only the colors in the PAR entry. This is a handy tool for
  converting maps into compressed PAR colors entry. For example, you could
  type:
       fractint map=lyapunov.map makepar=mycolors &gt;&gt; makepar.log
  This adds a colors-only PAR entry called lyapunov.map to mycolors.par.

  MAXLINELENGTH=nnn
  This command sets the maximum width of lines in a PAR entry.

  COMMENT=[comment1]/[comment2]/[comment3]/[comment4]
  Inserts comments into PAR files. These comments can include variables
  that are expanded at the time the PAR file is created. Variables are
  indicated by $varname$. Underscore characters are expanded to blanks.
  If you want to include the special characters '$', '_', or '\' in a
  comment, precede the character with '\'. Supported variables are:

  Variable   Expands to   Example     Variable   Expands to   Example
  ===============================     ===============================
  $year$     time:year    1996        $date$     mo. day, yr  Aug 17, 1996
  $month$    time:month   Aug         $calctime$ h:m:s        4:34:45.3
  $day$      time:day     12          $version$  version      1940
  $hour$     time:hour    21          $patch$    patch number 2
  $min$      time:minute  34          $xdots$    horiz rez    640
  $sec$      time:sec     14          $ydots$    vertical rez 480
  $time$     time:h:m:s   21:34:14    $vidkey$   video key    SF4

  You can leave any of the four comment fields unchanged by leaving that
  position blank. For example, the command comment=//Created_$date$
  inserts the text "Created Aug 17, 1996" into the third comment.

  BATCH=yes
  See Batch Mode (p. 148).

  AUTOKEY=play|record
  Specifying "play" runs Fractint in playback mode - keystrokes are read
  from the autokey file (see next parameter) and interpreted as if they're
  being entered from the keyboard.

  Specifying "record" runs in recording mode - all keystrokes are recorded
  in the autokey file.

  See also Autokey Mode (p. 89).

  AUTOKEYNAME=[filename]
  Specifies the file name to be used in autokey mode. The default file
  name is AUTO.KEY.

  MAKEDOC[=filename]
  Create Fractint documentation file (for printing or viewing with a text
  editor) and then return to DOS.  Filename defaults to FRACTINT.DOC.
  There's also a function in Fractint's online help which can be used to
  produce the documentation file - use "Printing Fractint Documentation"
  from the main help index.

  MAXHISTORY=&lt;nnn&gt;
  Fractint maintains a list of parameters of the past 10 images that you
  generated in the current Fractint session. You can revisit these images
  using the &lt;h&gt; and &lt;Ctrl-h&gt; commands. The maxhistory command allows you
  to set the number of image parameter sets stored in memory. The tradeoff
  is between the convenience of storing more images and memory use. Each
  image in the circular history buffer takes up over 1200 bytes, so the
  default value of ten images uses up 12,000 bytes of memory. If your
  memory is very tight, and some memory-intensive Fractint operations are
  giving "out of memory" messages, you can reduce maxistory to 2 or even
  zero. Keep in mind that every time you color cycle or change from
  integer to float or back, another image parameter set is saved, so the
  default ten images are used up quickly.

  FPU=387
  This parameter is useful if you have an unusual coprocessor chip. If you
  have a 80287 replacement chip with full 80387 functionality use
  "FPU=387" to inform Fractint to take advantage of those extra 387
  instructions.
