  wish to use a different lsystem file. After selecting an lsystem, you
  are asked for one parameter - the "order", or number of times to execute
  all the transformation rules.  It is wise to start with small orders,
  because the size of the substituted command string grows exponentially
  and it is very easy to exceed your resolution.  (Higher orders take
  longer to generate too.)  The command line options "lname=" and "lfile="
  can be used to over-ride the default file name and lsystem name.

  Each L-System entry in the file contains a specification of the angle,
  the axiom, and the transformation rules.  Each item must appear on its
  own line and each line must be less than 160 characters long.

  The statement "angle n" sets the angle to 360/n degrees; n must be an
  integer greater than two and less than fifty.

  "Axiom string" defines the axiom.

  Transformation rules are specified as "a=string" and convert the single
  character 'a' into "string."  If more than one rule is specified for a
  single character all of the strings will be added together.  This allows
  specifying transformations longer than the 160 character limit.
  Transformation rules may operate on any characters except space, tab or
  '}'.

  Any information after a ; (semi-colon) on a line is treated as a
  comment.

  Here is a sample lsystem:

  Dragon {         ; Name of lsystem, { indicates start
    Angle 8        ; Specify the angle increment to 45 degrees
    Axiom FX       ; Starting character string
    F=             ; First rule:  Delete 'F'
    y=+FX--FY+     ; Change 'y' into  "+fx--fy+"
    x=-FX++FY-     ; Similar transformation on 'x'
  }                ; final } indicates end

  The standard drawing commands are:
      F Draw forward
      G Move forward (without drawing)
      + Increase angle
      - Decrease angle
      | Try to turn 180 degrees. (If angle is odd, the turn
        will be the largest possible turn less than 180 degrees.)

  These commands increment angle by the user specified angle value. They
  should be used when possible because they are fast. If greater
  flexibility is needed, use the following commands which keep a
  completely separate angle pointer which is specified in degrees.

      D   Draw forward
      M   Move forward
      \nn Increase angle nn degrees
      /nn Decrease angle nn degrees
