 1.2 Plotting Commands

  Function keys &amp; various combinations are used to select a video mode and
  redraw the screen.  For a quick start try one of the following:
    If you have MCGA, VGA, or better:  &lt;F3&gt;
    If you have EGA:                   &lt;F9&gt;
    If you have CGA:                   &lt;F5&gt;
    Otherwise, monochrome:             &lt;F6&gt;

  &lt;F1&gt;
  Display a help screen. The function keys available in help mode are
  displayed at the bottom of the help screen.

  &lt;M&gt; or &lt;Esc&gt;
  Return from a displayed image to the main menu.

  &lt;Esc&gt;
  From the main menu, &lt;Esc&gt; is used to exit from Fractint.

  &lt;Delete&gt;
  Same as choosing "select video mode" from the main menu.  Goes to the
  "select video mode" screen.  See Video Mode Function Keys (p. 36).

  &lt;h&gt;
  Redraw the previous image in the circular history buffer, revisiting
  fractals you previously generated this session in reverse order.
  Fractint saves the last ten images worth of information including
  fractal type, coordinates, colors, and all options. Image information is
  saved only when some item changes. After ten images the circular buffer
  wraps around and earlier information is overwritten. You can set image
  capacity of the history feature using the maxhistory=&lt;nnn&gt; command.
  About 1200 bytes of memory is required for each image slot.

  &lt;Ctrl-h&gt;
  Redraw the next image in the circular history buffer. Use this to return
  to images you passed by when using &lt;h&gt;.

  &lt;Tab&gt;
  Display the current fractal type, parameters, video mode, screen or (if
  displayed) zoom-box coordinates, maximum iteration count, and other
  information useful in keeping track of where you are.  The Tab function
  is non-destructive - if you press it while in the midst of generating an
  image, you will continue generating it when you return.  The Tab
  function tells you if your image is still being generated or has
  finished - a handy feature for those overnight, 1024x768 resolution
  fractal images.  If the image is incomplete, it also tells you whether
  it can be interrupted and resumed.  (Any function other than &lt;Tab&gt; and
  &lt;F1&gt; counts as an "interrupt".)

  The Tab screen also includes a pixel-counting function, which will count
  the number of pixels colored in the inside color.  This gives an
  estimate of the area of the fractal.  Note that the inside color must be
  different from the outside color(s) for this to work; inside=0 is a good
  choice.

  &lt;T&gt;
  Select a fractal type. Move the cursor to your choice (or type the first
  few letters of its name) and hit &lt;Enter&gt;. Next you will be prompted for
  any parameters used by the selected type - hit &lt;Enter&gt; for the defaults.
  See Fractal Types (p. 43) for a list of supported types.

  &lt;F&gt;
  Toggles the use of floating-point algorithms (see "Limitations of
  Integer Math (And How We Cope)" (p. 166)).  Whether floating point is in
  use is shown on the &lt;Tab&gt; status screen.  The floating point option can
  also be turned on and off using the "X" options screen.  If you have a
  non-Intel floating point chip which supports the full 387 instruction
  set, see the "FPU=" command in Startup Parameters (p. 122) to get the
  most out of your chip.

  &lt;X&gt;
  Select a number of eXtended options. Brings up a full-screen menu of
  options, any of which you can change at will.  These options are:
    "passes=" - see Drawing Method (p. 86)
    Floating point toggle - see &lt;F&gt; key description below
    "maxiter=" - see Image Calculation Parameters (p. 126)
    "inside=" and "outside=" - see Color Parameters (p. 128)
    "savename=" filename - see File Parameters (p. 133)
    "overwrite=" option - see File Parameters (p. 133)
    "sound=" option - see Sound Parameters (p. 137)
    "logmap=" - see Logarithmic Palettes and Color Ranges (p. 93)
    "biomorph=" - see Biomorphs (p. 95)
    "decomp=" - see Decomposition (p. 93)
    "fillcolor=" - see Drawing Method (p. 86)

  &lt;Y&gt;
  More options which we couldn't fit under the &lt;X&gt; command:
    "finattract=" - see Finite Attractors (p. 185)
    "potential=" parameters - see Continuous Potential (p. 95)
    "invert=" parameters - see Inversion (p. 92)
    "distest=" parameters - see Distance Estimator Method (p. 91)
    "cyclerange=" - see Color Cycling Commands (p. 23)

  &lt;P&gt;
  Options that apply to the Passes feature:
    "periodicity=" - see Periodicity Logic (p. 166)
    "orbitdelay=" - see Passes Parameters (p. 150)
    "orbitinterval=" - see Passes Parameters (p. 150)
    "screencoords=" - see Passes Parameters (p. 150)
    "orbitdrawmode=" - see Passes Parameters (p. 150)

  &lt;Z&gt;
  Modify the parameters specific to the currently selected fractal type.
  This command lets you modify the parameters which are requested when you
  select a new fractal type with the &lt;T&gt; command, without having to repeat
  that selection. You can enter "e" or "p" in column one of the input
  fields to get the numbers e and pi (2.71828... and 3.14159...).
  From the fractal parameters screen, you can press &lt;F6&gt; to bring up a sub
  parameter screen for the coordinates of the image's corners.  With
  selected fractal types, &lt;Z&gt; allows you to change the Bailout Test
  (p. 98).

  &lt;+&gt; or &lt;-&gt;
  Switch to color-cycling mode and begin cycling the palette by shifting
  each color to the next "contour."  See Color Cycling Commands (p. 23).

  &lt;C&gt;
  Switch to color-cycling mode but do not start cycling.  The normally
  black "overscan" border of the screen changes to white.  See Color
  Cycling Commands (p. 23).

  &lt;E&gt;
  Enter Palette-Editing Mode.  See Palette Editing Commands (p. 25).

  &lt;Spacebar&gt;
  Toggle between Mandelbrot set images and their corresponding Julia-set
  images. Read the notes in Fractal Types, Julia Sets (p. 44) before
  trying this option if you want to see anything interesting.

  &lt;J&gt;
  Toggle between Julia escape time fractal and the Inverse Julia orbit
  fractal. See Inverse Julias (p. 46)

  &lt;Enter&gt;
  Enter is used to resume calculation after a pause. It is only necessary
  to do this when there is a message on the screen waiting to be
  acknowledged, such as the message shown after you save an image to disk.

  &lt;I&gt;
  Modify 3D transformation parameters used with 3D fractal types such as
  "Lorenz3D" and 3D "IFS" definitions, including the selection of "funny
  glasses" (p. 110) red/blue 3D.

  &lt;A&gt;
  Convert the current image into a fractal 'starfield'.  See Starfields
  (p. 97).

  &lt;Ctrl-A&gt;
  Unleash an image-eating ant automaton on current image. See Ant
  Automaton (p. 79).

  &lt;Ctrl-S&gt; (or &lt;k&gt;)
  Convert the current image into a Random Dot Stereogram (RDS).  See
  Random Dot Stereograms (RDS) (p. 102).

  &lt;O&gt; (the letter, not the number)
  If pressed while an image is being generated, toggles the display of
  intermediate results -- the "orbits" Fractint uses as it calculates
  values for each point. Slows the display a bit, but shows you how clever
  the program is behind the scenes. (See "A Little Code" in "Fractals and
  the PC" (p. 164).)

  &lt;D&gt;
  Shell to DOS. Return to Fractint by entering "exit" at a DOS prompt.

  &lt;Insert&gt;
  Restart at the "credits" screen and reset most variables to their
  initial state.  Variables which are not reset are: savename, lightname,
  video, startup filename.

  &lt;L&gt;
  Enter Browsing Mode.  See Browse Commands (p. 37).

  &lt;Ctrl-E&gt;
  Enter Explorer/Evolver Mode.  See Evolver Commands (p. 38).
