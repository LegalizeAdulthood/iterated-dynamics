/************************ super solid guessing *****************************/

/*
   I, Timothy Wegner, invented this solidguessing idea and implemented it in
   more or less the overall framework you see here.  I am adding this note
   now in a possibly vain attempt to secure my place in history, because
   Pieter Branderhorst has totally rewritten this routine, incorporating
   a *MUCH* more sophisticated algorithm.  His revised code is not only
   faster, but is also more accurate. Harrumph!

Fractint's original btm was written by David Guenther.  There were a few
rare circumstances in which the original btm would not trace or fill
correctly, even on Mandelbrot Sets.  The code below was adapted from
"Mandelbrot Sets by Wesley Loewer" (see calmanfp.asm) which was written
before I was introduced to Fractint.  It should be noted that without
David Guenther's implimentation of a btm, I doubt that I would have been
able to impliment my own code into Fractint.  There are several things in
the following code that are not original with me but came from David
Guenther's code.  I've noted these places with the initials DG.
