 5.6 Calculation Mode Parameters

  PASSES=1|2|3|g|g1|g2|g3|g4|g5|g6|b|t|s|o
  Selects single-pass, dual-pass, triple-pass, solid-Guessing mode, solid-
  Guessing stop after pass n, Boundary Tracing, Tesseral, Synchronous
  Orbits, or the Orbits algorithm.  See Drawing Method (p. 86) and Passes
  Parameters (p. 150).

  FILLCOLOR=normal|&lt;nnn&gt;
  Sets a color to be used for block fill by Boundary Tracing and Tesseral
  algorithms.  See Drawing Method (p. 86).

  FLOAT=yes
  Most fractal types have both a fast integer math and a floating point
  version. The faster, but possibly less accurate, integer version is the
  default. The default is to use integer math, but in this age of pentium
  (amd later) CPUS we now recommend your making float=yes the default by
  adding this line to your SSTOOLS.INI file.  Also see "Limitations of
  Integer Math (And How We Cope)" (p. 166).

  SYMMETRY=xxx
  Forces symmetry to None, Xaxis, Yaxis, XYaxis, Origin, or Pi symmetry.
  Useful as a speedup for symmetrical fractals. This is not a kaleidoscope
  feature for imposing symmetry where it doesn't exist. Use only when the
  fractal actual exhibits the symmetry, or else results may not be
  satisfactory.

  BFDIGITS=&lt;nnn&gt;
  Forces nnn digits if arbitrary precision used. You can use this if
  fractint's precision detection changes to arbitrary precision too late
  and regular double precision is used with poor results.

  MATHTOLERANCE=&lt;nnn&gt;/&lt;nnn&gt;
  This commands controls the logic that automatically selects one of
  integer/float/arbitrary precision based on precision requirements of the
  current zoom depth. The first number controls the integer/float
  transition, and the second number controls the float/arbitrary precision
  transition. The default value of .05 for both means that the ratio
  between the exact and calculated width and height is between .95 and
  1.05. A larger value than .05 (say .10) makes the test looser so that
  the lower precision math is used longer. A value &lt;= 0 means the test is
  always failed and the higher precision math type is used. A value &gt;= 1
  means that the test is always passed and the lower precision math type
  is used.

  MINSTACK=&lt;nnn&gt;
  This sets the minimum number of stack bytes required for passes=s in
  order to do another SOI recursion. If you get bad results, try setting
  this to a value above the default value of 1100. If the value is too
  large, the image will be OK but generation will be slower.
