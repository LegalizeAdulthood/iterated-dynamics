 5.13 Sound Parameters

  SOUND=off|beep|x|y|z/pc|fm/quant
  We're all MUCH too busy to waste time with Fractint at work, and no
  doubt you are too, so "sound=off" is included only for use at home, to
  avoid waking the kids or your Significant Other, late at night. (By the
  way, didn't you tell yourself "just one more zoom on LambdaSine" an hour
  ago?)  Suggestions for a "boss" hot-key will be cheerfully ignored, as
  this sucker is getting big enough without including a spreadsheet screen
  too.  The "sound=x|y|x" options are for the "attractor" fractals, like
  the Lorenz fractals - they play with the sound on your PC speaker as
  they are generating an image, based on the X or Y or Z co-ordinate they
  are displaying at the moment.

  The scope of the sound command has been extended. You can now hear the
  sound of fractal orbits--just turn on sound from the command line, the
  &lt;X&gt; menu, or the &lt;cntl-F&gt; menu, fire up a fractal, and try the &lt;O&gt;rbits
  command (or set showorbit=yes).  Use the orbitdelay=&lt;nnn&gt; command (also
  on the &lt;cntl-F&gt; menu) to dramatically alter the effect, which ranges
  from an unearthly scream to a series of discrete tones. Not recommended
  when people you have to live with are nearby!  Remember, we don't
  promise that it will sound beautiful!

  The sound output can now be directed to the PC speaker, a sound card
  with OPL-3 support, or both at the same time.  There is also an option
  to quantize the notes generated by Fractint.  See Sound Controls
  (p. 138).

  You can also "hear" any image that Fractint can decode; turn on sound
  before using &lt;R&gt; to read in a GIF file. We have no idea if this feature
  is useful. It was inspired by the comments of an on-line friend who is
  blind. We solicit feedback and suggestions from anyone who finds these
  sound features interesting or useful. The orbitdelay command also
  affects the sound of decoding images.

  HERTZ=&lt;nnn&gt;
  Adjusts the sound produced by the "sound=x|y|z" option.  Limits on legal
  values have been removed in version 19.3.  The actual sounds produced
  are limited to the range of 20-5000 Hz.  Setting a negative Hertz value
  allows shifting the range of sounds produced down into the bass range.
  This also eliminates some of the notes since anything under 20 Hz or
  over 5000 Hz will not be played.

  ORBITDELAY=&lt;nn&gt;
  Slows up the display of orbits using the &lt;O&gt; command for folks with hot
  new computers. Units are in 1/10000 seconds per orbit point.
  ORBITDELAY=10 therefore allows you to see each pixel's orbit point for
  about one millisecond. For best display of orbits, try passes=1 and a
  moderate resolution such as 320x200.  Note that the first time you press
  the 'O' key with the 'orbitdelay' function active, your computer will
  pause for a half-second or so to calibrate a high-resolution timer.

  SHOWORBIT=yes|no
  Causes the during-generation orbits feature, toggled by the &lt;O&gt; command,
  to start off in the "on" position each time a new fractal calculation
  starts.

  ORBITSAVE=sound
  This option causes the hertz value played through the PC speaker with
  sound=x|y|z option to be written to a file "sound.txt" in the current
  directory. Bill Jemison has made some intriguing music with this option.
