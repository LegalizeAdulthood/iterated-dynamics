 Appendix B Stone Soup With Pixels: The Authors

  THE STONE SOUP STORY

  Once upon a time, somewhere in Eastern Europe, there was a great famine.
  People jealously hoarded whatever food they could find, hiding it even
  from their friends and neighbors. One day a peddler drove his wagon into
  a village, sold a few of his wares, and began asking questions as if he
  planned to stay for the night.

  [No!  No!  It was three Russian Soldiers! - Lee Crocker]
  [Wait!  I heard it was a Wandering Confessor! - Doug Quinn]
  [Well *my* kids have a book that uses Russian Soldiers! - Bert]
  [Look, who's writing this documentation, anyway? - Monte]
  [Ah, but who gets it *last* and gets to upload it? - Bert]

  "There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "Better
  keep moving on."

  "Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of
  making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron
  cauldron from his wagon, filled it with water, and built a fire under
  it.  Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a
  velvet bag and dropped it into the water.

  By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come to the
  square or watched from their windows. As the peddler sniffed the "broth"
  and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their
  skepticism.

  "Ahh," the peddler said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty
  stone soup. Of course, stone soup with CABBAGE -- that's hard to beat."

  Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a cabbage he'd retrieved
  from its hiding place, and added it to the pot. "Capital!" cried the
  peddler. "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt
  beef as well, and it was fit for a king."

  The village butcher managed to find some salt beef...and so it went,
  through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was
  indeed a delicious meal for all. The villagers offered the peddler a
  great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell and
  traveled on the next day. And from that time on, long after the famine
  had ended, they reminisced about the finest soup they'd ever had.

                                  ***

  That's the way Fractint has grown, with quite a bit of magic, although
  without the element of deception. (You don't have to deceive programmers
  to make them think that hours of painstaking, often frustrating work is
  fun... they do it to themselves.)

  It wouldn't have happened, of course, without Benoit Mandelbrot and the
  explosion of interest in fractal graphics that has grown from his work
  at IBM. Or without the example of other Mandelplotters for the PC. Or
  without those wizards who first realized you could perform Mandelbrot

  algorithms when we steal--uhh--see them).  Or those graphics experts who
  hang around the CompuServe PICS forum and keep adding video modes to the
  program.  Or...

  A WORD ABOUT THE AUTHORS

  Fractint is the result of a synergy between the main authors, many
  contributors, and published sources.  All of the main authors have had a
  hand in many aspects of the code.  However, each author has certain
  areas of greater contribution and creativity.  Since there is not room
  in the credits screen for the contributions of the main authors, we list
  these here to facilitate those who would like to communicate with us on
  particular subjects.

  Main Authors of Version 19 and later.

  BERT TYLER is the original author of Fractint.  He wrote the "blindingly
  fast" 386-specific 32 bit integer math code and the original video mode
  logic. Bert made Stone Soup possible, and provides a sense of direction
  when we need it. His forte is writing fast 80x86 assembler, his
  knowledge of a variety of video hardware, and his skill at hacking up
  the code we send him!

  Bert has a BA in mathematics from Cornell University.  He has been in
  programming since he got a job at the computer center in his sophomore
  year at college - in other words, he hasn't done an honest day's work in
  his life.  He has been known to pass himself off as a PC expert, a UNIX
  expert, a statistician, and even a financial modeling expert.  He is
  currently masquerading as an independent PC consultant, supporting the
  PC-to-Mainframe communications environment at NIH.  If you sent mail
  from the Internet to an NIH staffer on his 3+Mail system, it was
  probably Bert's code that mangled it during the Internet-to-3+Mail
  conversion.  He also claims to support the MS-Kermit environment at NIH.
  Fractint is Bert's first effort at building a graphics program.

  TIM WEGNER contributed the original implementation of palette animation,
  and is responsible for most of the 3D mechanisms.  He provided the main
  outlines of the "StandardFractal" engine and data structures, and is
  accused by his cohorts of being "obsessed with options". One of Tim's
  main interests is the use of four dimensional algebras to produce
  fractals.  Tim served as team coordinator for version 19, and integrated
  Wes Loewer's arbitrary precision library into Fractint.

  Tim has BA and MA degrees in mathematics from Carleton College and the
  University of California Berkeley.  He worked for 7 years overseas as a
  volunteer, doing things like working with Egyptian villagers building
  water systems. Since returning to the US in 1982, he has written shuttle
  navigation software, a software support environment prototype, and
  supported strategic information planning, all at NASA's Johnson Space
  Center. After a two-year stint at full-time writing, he's back at NASA
  developing shuttle navigation software.

  JONATHAN OSUCH started throwing pebbles into the soup around version
  15.0 with a method for simulating an if-then-else structure using the
  formula parser.  He has contributed the fn||fn fractal types, the built-

  in bailout tests, the increase in both the maximum iteration count and
  bailout value, and bug fixes too numerous to count. Jonathan worked
  closely with Robin Bussell to implement Robin's browser mechanism in
  Fractint.

  Jonathan has a B.S. in Physics from the University of Dubuque and a B.S.
  in Computer Science from Mount Mercy College, both in Iowa.  He is
  currently working as a consultant in the nuclear power industry.

  WES LOEWER first got his foot in the Stone Soup door by writing fast
  floating point assembler routines for Mandelbrot, Julia, and Lyapunov
  fractals.  He also rewrote the boundary trace algorithms and added the
  frothybasin fractal.  His most significant contribution is the addition
  of the arbitrary precision library which allows Fractint to perform
  incredibly deep zooms.

  Wes has a B.S. in Physics from Wheaton College in Illinois.  He also
  holds an M.S. in Physics and an M.Ed. in Education from Texas A&amp;M
  University.  Wes teaches physics and math at McCullough High School in
  The Woodlands, Texas where his pupils inspire him to keep that sense of
  amazement that students get when they understand a physical or
  mathematical principle for the first time.  Since he uses Fractint to
  help teach certain mathematical principles, he's one of the few folks
  who actually gets to use Fractint on the job.  Besides his involvement
  with Fractint, Wes is the author of WL-Plot, an equation graphing
  program, and MatCalc, a matrix calculator program.

  GEORGE MARTIN first became known to Fractint users when he brought a
  modicum of order to the chaotic world of formula postings with his
  release of the Orgform program and formula compilation. George added
  IF..ELSE to the formula parser language for version 19.6. Among his
  other contributions are the ability to include formula, ifs, and lsystem
  entries in .par files, the scrolling of text in the &lt;z&gt; and F2 screens,
  and new autokey commands.

  George received an A.B. in Economics from Dartmouth College and a J.D
  from the University of Michigan. When not playing with Fractint, he
  practices law in a small village about 40 miles northwest of Detroit.


  ROBIN BUSSELL began contributing to fractint in rudimentary fashion with
  the autologmap routine and has been producing more and more complex
  interface enhancements as he gets better at what he refers to as 'this C
  programming lark' He is always grateful for the help the rest of the
  team have given in smoothing the rough edges of the ingredients he adds
  to the soup and regards the evolver feature as his greatest achievement
  to date.

  Robin had far too much fun at college in London to actually get any
  qualifications there and has since worked his way up from a workshop job
  fixing computers back in the final days of CPM, via some interesting
  work with Transputers ( an innovative British cpu that was designed to
  run in massively parallel configurations, and made a very good
  Mandlebrot set calculating machine when a few dozen or more were set to
  the task) , through to his current position of senior engineer for a
  third party suppport company where he spends his time travelling the

  offer him interesting work in anything to do with computers can find a
  CV at: http://web.ukonline.co.uk/robin.b2/rbcv.htm

  When not playing with computers Robin likes to relax by experimenting
  with kite powered traction and can often be found hurtling around the
  local beaches on the end of a few square metres of fabric and carbon
  fibre in various configurations.

  DISTRIBUTION OF FRACTINT

  New versions of FRACTINT are uploaded to the Fractint developer's web
  site at www.fractint.org, and make their way to other systems from that
  point.  FRACTINT is available as two self-extracting archive files -
  FRAINT.EXE (executable &amp; documentation) and FRASRC.EXE (source code).

  The latest developer's version can also be found at www.fractint.org.

  Many other sites tend to carry these files shortly after their initial
  release (although sometimes using different naming conventions).  Look
  for frainnn.zip (executable package) and frasrnnn.zip (source), where
  nnn is the release number. Major releases with two digit numbers have
  names such as fraintnn.zip and frasrcnn.zip.

  On the Internet, try the Noel Giffin's Spanky Fractal Database. Using a
  Web browser, go to:
  http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/programs/ibmpc/frainxxx.zip
  where xxx is the release number.

  Via FTP, login to spanky.triumf.ca as ANONYMOUS, and change directories
  to [pub.fractals.programs.ibmpc], then download frainxxx.zip. (The
  directory syntax is in VAX format.)

  The X Windows port of Fractint was written by Ken Shirriff and is
  available via FTP from
  http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/programs/unix/XFRACTxxx.zip
  where xxx is the Xfractint release number.  Developer's versions of
  Xfractint are available at the Fractint developer's web site.
