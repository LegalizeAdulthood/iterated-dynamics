 5. Command Line Parameters, Parameter Files, Batch Mode

  Fractint accepts command-line parameters that allow you to start it with
  a particular video mode, fractal type, starting coordinates, and just
  about every other parameter and option.

  These parameters can also be specified in a SSTOOLS.INI file, to set
  them every time you run Fractint.

  They can also be specified as named groups in a .PAR (parameter) file
  which you can then call up while running Fractint by using the &lt;@&gt;
  command.

  In all three cases (DOS command line, SSTOOLS.INI, and parameter file)
  the parameters use the same syntax, usually a series of keyword=value
  commands like SOUND=OFF.  Each parameter is described in detail in
  subsequent sections.


 5.1 Using the DOS Command Line

  You can specify parameters when you start Fractint from DOS by using a
  command like:

      FRACTINT SOUND=OFF FILENAME=MYIMAGE.GIF

  The individual parameters are separated by one or more spaces (an
  parameter itself may not include spaces). Upper or lower case may be
  used, and parameters can be in any order.

  Since DOS commands are limited to 128 characters, Fractint has a special
  command you can use when you have a lot of startup parameters (or have a
  set of parameters you use frequently):

      FRACTINT @MYFILE

  When @filename is specified on the command line, Fractint reads
  parameters from the specified file as if they were keyed on the command
  line.  You can create the file with a text editor, putting one
  "keyword=value" parameter on each line.


 5.2 Setting Defaults (SSTOOLS.INI File)

  Every time Fractint runs, it searches the current directory, and then
  the directories in your DOS PATH, for a file named SSTOOLS.INI.  If it
  finds this file, it begins by reading parameters from it.  This file is
  useful for setting parameters you always want, such as those defining
  your printer setup.

  SSTOOLS.INI is divided into sections belonging to particular programs.
  Each section begins with a label in brackets. Fractint looks for the
  label [fractint], and ignores any lines it finds in the file belonging
  to any other label. If an SSTOOLS.INI file looks like this:
