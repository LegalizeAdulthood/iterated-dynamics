 6. Hardware Support


 6.1 Notes on Video Modes, "Standard" and Otherwise

  Alas, in this day of Windows, video adapter manufacturers do not have
  much incentive to support DOS video modes. Fractint can support any
  video modes included in your board's VESA video bios. Many otherwise
  good boards do not include the higher resolution modes in their bios
  even though those modes are supported in the manufacturer's Windows
  driver.

  Fractint users are particularly fond of the 1600x1200 mode. If you want
  to use this mode, make sure your video board supports it. Some boards
  that have given good results are boards from STB, various versions of
  Matrox Millennium, and boards from several manufacturers using Nvidia
  Riva chip sets.

  Using high resolution video modes poses a second challenge for fractint
  users.  That is that the VESA standard does not have standard settings
  for this mode, so you will have to edit the fractint.cfg file to support
  your board. You can run the program makefcfg.exe that comes with
  fractint to generate entries for your fractint.cfg file.

  Finally, even if your video board VESA Bios supports high resolution
  video modes, it probably doesn't come with a utility that allows you to
  set the vertical refresh. If the vertical refresh is set for 60 Hz or
  less, you may see flicker and be subject to headaches. Fortunately,
  there is a wonderful freeware utility by Rob Muller that allows you to
  control the vertical refresh for any VESA video mode. Of course your
  monitor still needs to be able to support higher rates -- software can't
  help that. To get Rob's unirefresh program, email Rob at
  r.muller@student.utwente.nl or check out

  True to the spirit of public-domain programming, Fractint makes only a
  limited attempt to verify that your video adapter can run in the mode
  you specify, or even that an adapter is present, before writing to it.
  So if you use the "video=" command line parameter, check it before using
  a new version of Fractint - the old key combo may now call an
  ultraviolet holographic mode.

  EGA

  Fractint assumes that every EGA adapter has a full 256K of memory (and
  can therefore display 640 x 350 x 16 colors), but does nothing to verify
  that fact before slinging pixels.

  "TWEAKED" VGA MODES

  The IBM VGA adapter is a highly programmable device, and can be set up
  to display many video-mode combinations beyond those "officially"
  supported by the IBM BIOS. E.g. 320x400x256 and 360x480x256 (the latter
  is one of our favorites).  These video modes are perfectly legal, but
  temporarily reprogram the adapter (IBM or fully register-compatible) in
