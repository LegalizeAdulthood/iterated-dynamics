 4.5 3D Color Parameters

  You are asked for a range of "transparent" colors, if any. This option
  is most useful when using the 3D Overlay Mode (p. 115).  Enter the color
  range (minimum and maximum value) for which you do not want to overwrite
  whatever may already be on the screen. The default is no transparency
  (overwrite everything).

  Now, for the final option. This one will smooth the transition between
  colors by randomizing them and reduce the banding that occurs with some
  maps. Select the value of randomize to between 0 (for no effect) and 7
  (to randomize your colors almost beyond use). 3 is a good starting
  point.

  That's all for this screen. Press enter for these parameters and the
  next and final screen will appear (honestly!).
