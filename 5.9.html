 5.9 Color Parameters

  INSIDE=nnn|maxiter|bof60|bof61|zmag|epscross|startrail|period|atan|fmod
  Set the color of the interior: for example, "inside=0" makes the M-set
  "lake" a stylish basic black. A setting of inside=maxiter makes the
  inside color the same as the value of maxiter.

  Eight more options reveal hidden structure inside the lake.
  Inside=bof60 and inside=bof61, are named after the figures on pages 60
  and 61 of "Beauty of Fractals".  Inside=zmag is a method of coloring
  based on the magnitude of Z after the maximum iterations have been
  reached.  The affect along the edges of the Mandelbrot is like thin-
  metal welded sculpture.  Inside=fmod is a method of coloring based on
  the magnitude of the last orbit within a set distance from the origin.
  Inside=period colors pixels according to the period of their eventual
  orbit.  Inside=atan colors by determining the angle in degrees the last
  iterated value has with respect to the real axis, and using the absolute
  value.  See Inside=bof60|bof61|zmag|fmod|period|atan (p. 184) for a
  brilliant explanation of what these do!

  Inside=epscross colors pixels green or yellow according to whether their
  orbits swing close to the Y-axis or X-axis, respectively.
  Inside=startrail has a coloring scheme based on clusters of points in
  the orbits. Best with outside=&lt;nnn&gt;. For more information, see
  Inside=epscross|startrail (p. 185).

  Note that the "Look for finite attractor" option on the &lt;Y&gt; options
  screen will override the selected inside option if an attractor is found
  - see Finite Attractors (p. 185).

  OUTSIDE=nnn|iter|real|imag|summ|mult|atan|fmod|tdis
  The classic method of coloring outside the fractal is to color according
  to how many iterations were required before Z reached the bailout value,
  usually 4. This is the method used when OUTSIDE=iter.

  However, when Z reaches bailout the real and imaginary components can be
  at very diferent values.  OUTSIDE=real and OUTSIDE=imag color using the
  iteration value plus the real or imaginary values.  OUTSIDE=summ uses
  the sum of all these values.  These options can give a startling 3d
  quality to otherwise flat images and can change some boring images to
  wonderful ones. OUTSIDE=mult colors by multiplying the iteration by real
  divided by imaginary. There was no mathematical reason for this, it just
  seemed like a good idea.  OUTSIDE=atan colors by determining the angle
  in degrees the last iterated value has with respect to the real axis,
  and using the absolute value.

  OUTSIDE=fmod colors pixels according to the magnitude of the last orbit
  point which is within a set distance from the origin.  Then:
    color = magnitude * colors / closeprox
  The magnitude used for the comparison is now based on the same
  calculation as is used for the bailout test.  The value of closeprox can
  be varied interactively.  This feature was contributed by Iain Stirling.
  There is a problem with the mandel fractal type when outside=fmod is
  used with inside=bof6x and bailoutest=real, imag, or manr.  This is
  likely due to changes made in the code so that bof images could be
  reproduced.  Select a different fractal type that produces the default
  mandel image to explore using these parameters.

  OUTSIDE=tdis colors the pixels according to the total distance traveled
  by the orbit.  This feature was suggested by Steve Robinson.

  Outside=nnn sets the color of the exterior to some number of your
  choosing: for example, "OUTSIDE=1" makes all points not INSIDE the
  fractal set to color 1 (blue). Note that defining an OUTSIDE color
  forces any image to be a two-color one: either a point is INSIDE the
  set, or it's OUTSIDE it.

  MAP=[filename]
  Reads in a replacement color map from [filename]. This map replaces the
  default color map of your video adapter. Requires a VGA or higher
  adapter.  The difference between this argument and an alternate map read
  in via &lt;L&gt; in color-command mode is that this one applies to the entire
  run.  See Palette Maps (p. 88).

  COLORS=@filename|colorspecification
  Sets colors for the current image, like the &lt;L&gt; function in color
  cycling and palette editing modes. Unlike the MAP= parameter, colors set
  with COLORS= do not replace the default - when you next select a new
  fractal type, colors will revert to their defaults.

  COLORS=@filename tells Fractint to use a color map file named
  "filename".  See Palette Maps (p. 88).

  COLORS=colorspecification specifies the colors directly. The value of
  "colorspecification" is rather long (768 characters for 256 color
  modes), and its syntax is not documented here.  This form of the COLORS=
  command is not intended for manual use - it exists for use by the &lt;B&gt;
  command when saving the description of a nice image.

  RECORDCOLORS=auto|comment|yes
  Controls the method of writing colors in PAR files. Auto causes the
  colors to be written in the colors=@mapfile form if the colors were
  loaded from a map. Use this mode if you manage your colors using map
  files. If you share PAR files with others, and have trouble remembering
  to send them the map file, use RECORDCOLORS=comment or yes. These modes
  force the writing of compressed color maps in the PAR file in all cases.
  The only difference is that the 'comment' option also writes the mapfile
  name in a comment so you can remember where the colors came from.

  CYCLERANGE=nnn/nnn
  Sets the range of color numbers to be animated during color cycling.
  The default is 1/255, i.e. just color number 0 (usually black) is not
  cycled.

  CYCLELIMIT=nnn
  Sets the speed of color cycling. Technically, the number of DAC
  registers updated during a single vertical refresh cycle. Legal values
  are 1 - 256, default is 55.

  TEXTCOLORS=mono
  Set text screen colors to simple black and white.

  TEXTCOLORS=aa/bb/cc/...
  Set text screen colors. Omit any value to use the default (e.g.
  textcolors=////50 to set just the 5th value). Each value is a 2 digit
  hexadecimal value; 1st digit is background color (from 0 to 7), 2nd
  digit is foreground color (from 0 to F).
  Color values are:
      0 black     8 gray
      1 blue      9 light blue
      2 green     A light green
      3 cyan      B light cyan
      4 red       C light red
      5 magenta   D light magenta
      6 brown     E yellow
      7 white     F bright white

  31 colors can be specified, their meanings are as follows:

      1  Fractint version info
      2  heading line development info (not used in released version)
    help:

     30  primary authors
     31  contributing authors
  The default is
     textcolors=1F/1A/2E/70/28/71/31/78/70/17/1F/1E/2F/3F/5F/07/
                0D/71/70/78/0F/70/0E/0F/4F/20/17/20/28/0F/07
  (In a real command file, all values must be on one line.)

  OLDDEMMCOLORS=yes|no
  Sets the coloring scheme used with the distance estimator method to the
  pre-version 16 scheme.

  TRUECOLOR=yes
  You can save either the default color scheme or the iteration escape
  value to a file called FRACTxxx.TGA.  This will allow experimentation
  with truecolor algorithms.  A C language source file that reads the file
  when iterates are used, is provided. Someday we'll have REAL truecolor
  support ...

  TRUEMODE=def|iter
  Determines whether the FRACTxxx.TGA file produced when TRUECOLOR=yes
  contains the iteration value or the default coloring scheme.

  NOBOF=yes|no
  Setting this parameter to yes causes the bof60 and bof61 inside options
  to function the same as the other inside options by making the per pixel
  initialization the same.  The per pixel initialization is normally
  different for the bof60 and bof61 options to reproduce the images in the
  book, "The Beauty of Fractals".  The default is no.
