 2.11 Plasma Clouds

  (type=plasma)

  Plasma clouds ARE real live fractals, even though we didn't know it at
  first. They are generated by a recursive algorithm that randomly picks
  colors of the corner of a rectangle, and then continues recursively
  quartering previous rectangles. Random colors are averaged with those of
  the outer rectangles so that small neighborhoods do not show much
  change, for a smoothed-out, cloud-like effect. The more colors your
  video mode supports, the better.  The result, believe it or not, is a
  fractal landscape viewed as a contour map, with colors indicating
  constant elevation.  To see this, save and view with the &lt;3&gt; command
  (see "3D" Images (p. 106)) and your "cloud" will be converted to a
  mountain!

  You've GOT to try color cycling (p. 23) on these (hit "+" or "-").  If
  you haven't been hypnotized by the drawing process, the writhing colors
  will do it for sure. We have now implemented subliminal messages to
  exploit the user's vulnerable state; their content varies with your bank
  balance, politics, gender, accessibility to a Fractint programmer, and
  so on. A free copy of Microsoft C to the first person who spots them.

  This type accepts four parameters.

  The first determines how abruptly the colors change. A value of .5
  yields bland clouds, while 50 yields very grainy ones. The default value
  is 2.

  The second determines whether to use the original algorithm (0) or a
  modified one (1). The new one gives the same type of images but draws
  the dots in a different order. It will let you see what the final image
  will look like much sooner than the old one.

  The third determines whether to use a new seed for generating the next
  plasma cloud (0) or to use the previous seed (1).

  The fourth parameter turns on 16-bit .POT output which provides much
  smoother height gradations. This is especially useful for creating
  mountain landscapes when using the plasma output with a ray tracer such
  as POV-Ray.

  With parameter three set to 1, the next plasma cloud generated will be
  identical to the previous but at whatever new resolution is desired.

  Zooming is ignored, as each plasma-cloud screen is generated randomly.

  The random number seed used for each plasma image is displayed on the
  &lt;tab&gt; information screen, and can be entered with the command line
  parameter "rseed=" to recreate a particular image.

  The algorithm is based on the Pascal program distributed by Bret Mulvey
  as PLASMA.ARC. We have ported it to C and integrated it with Fractint's
  graphics and animation facilities. This implementation does not use
  floating-point math. The algorithm was modified starting with version 18
  so that the plasma effect is independent of screen resolution.

  Saved plasma-cloud screens are EXCELLENT starting images for fractal
  "landscapes" created with the "3D" commands (p. 32).
