  That's all for this screen. Press enter for these parameters and the
  next and final screen will appear (honestly!).


 4.6 Light Source Parameters

  This one deals with all the aspects of light source and Targa files.

  You must choose the direction of the light from the light source. This
  will be scaled in the x, y, and z directions the same as the image. For
  example, 1,1,3 positions the light to come from the lower right front of
  the screen in relation to the untransformed image. It is important to
  remember that these coordinates are scaled the same as your image. Thus,
  "1,1,1" positions the light to come from a direction of equal distances
  to the right, below and in front of each pixel on the original image.
  However, if the x,y,z scale is set to 90,90,30 the result will be from
  equal distances to the right and below each pixel but from only 1/3 the
  distance in front of the screen i.e.. it will be low in the sky, say,
  afternoon or morning.

  Then you are asked for a smoothing factor. Unless you used Continuous
  Potential (p. 95) when generating the starting image, the illumination
  when using light source fills may appear "sparkly", like a sandy beach
  in bright sun. A smoothing factor of 2 or 3 will allow you to see the
  large-scale shapes better.

  Smoothing is primarily useful when doing light source fill types with
  plasma clouds. If your fractal is not a plasma cloud and has features
  with sharply defined boundaries (e.g. Mandelbrot Lake), smoothing may
  cause the colors to run. This is a feature, not a bug. (A copyrighted
  response of [your favorite commercial software company here], used by

  The ambient option sets the minimum light value a surface has if it has
  no direct lighting at all. All light values are scaled from this value
  to white. This effectively adjusts the depth of the shadows and sets the
  overall contrast of the image.

  If you selected the full color option, you have a few more choices.  The
  next is the haze factor. Set this to make distant objects more hazy.
  Close up objects will have little effect, distant objects will have
  most.  0 disables the function. 100 is the maximum effect, the farthest
  objects will be lost in the mist. Currently, this does not really use
  distance from the viewer, we cheat and use the y value of the original
  image. So the effect really only works if the y-rotation (set earlier)
  is between +/- 30.

  Next, you can choose the name under which to save your Targa file. If
  you have a RAM disk handy, you might want to create the file on it, for
  speed.  So include its  full path name in this option. If you have not
  set "overwrite=yes" then the file name will be incremented to avoid
  over-writing previous files. If you are going to overlay an existing
  Targa file, enter its name here.
