  Version 14, 8/90

    LAST MINUTE NEWS FLASH!
      CompuServe announces the GIF89a on August 1, 1990, and Fractint
      supports it on August 2! GIF files can now contain fractal
      information!  Fractint now saves its files in the new GIF89a format
      by default, and uses .GIF rather than .FRA as a default filetype.
      Note that Fractint still *looks* for a .FRA file on file restores if
      it can't find a .GIF file, and can be coerced into using the old
      GIF87a format with the new 'gif87a=yes' command-line option.

    Pieter Branderhorst mounted a major campaign to get his name in
    lights:
    Mouse interface:  Diagonals, faster movement, improved feel. Mouse
      button assignments have changed - see the online help.
    Zoom box enhancements:  The zoom box can be rotated, stretched,
      skewed, and panned partially offscreen.  See "More Zoom Box
      Commands".
    FINALLY!! You asked for it and we (eventually, by talking Pieter into
      it [actually he grabbed it]) did it!  Images can be saved before
      completion, for a subsequent restore and continue.  See
      "Interrupting and Resuming" and "Batch Mode".
    Off-center symmetry:  Fractint now takes advantage of x or y axis
      symmetry anywhere on the screen to reduce drawing time.
    Panning:  If you move an image up, down, left, or right, and don't
      change anything else, only the new edges are calculated.
    Disk-video caching - it is now possible, reasonable even, to do most
      things with disk video, including solid guessing, 3d, and plasma.
    Logarithmic palette changed to use all colors.  It now matches regular
      palette except near the "lake".  "logmap=old" gets the old way.
    New "savetime=nnn" parameter to save checkpoints during long
    calculations.
    Calculation time is shown in &lt;Tab&gt; display.

    Kevin C Allen    Finite Attractor, Bifurcation Engine, Magnetic
    fractals...
    Made Bifurcation/Verhulst into a generalized Fractal Engine (like
      StandardFractal, but for Bifurcation types), and implemented
      periodicity checking for Bifurcation types to speed them up.
    Added Integer version of Verhulst Bifurcation (lots faster now).
      Integer is the default.  The Floating-Point toggle works, too.
    Added NEW Fractal types BIFLAMBDA, BIF+SINPI, and BIF=SINPI. These are
      Bifurcation types that make use of the new Engine. Floating-
      point/Integer toggle is available for BIFLAMBDA. The SINPI types are
      Floating-Point only, at this time.
    Corrected the generation of the MandelLambda Set.  Sorry, but it's
      always been wrong (up to v 12, at least).  Ask Mandelbrot !
    Added NEW Fractal types MAGNET1M, MAGNET1J, MAGNET2M, MAGNET2J from
      "The Beauty of Fractals".  Floating-Point only, so far, but what do
      you expect with THESE formulae ?!
    Added new symmetry types XAXIS NOIMAG and XAXIS NOREAL, required by
      the new MAGNETic Fractal types.
    Added Finite Attractor Bailout (FAB) logic to detect when iterations
      are approaching a known finite attractor. This is required by the
      new MAGNETic Fractal types.
    Added Finite Attractor Detection (FAD) logic which can be used by
      *SOME* Julia types prior to generating an image, to test for finite
      attractors, and find their values, for use by FAB logic. Can be used
      by the new MAGNETic Fractal Types, Lambda Sets, and some other Julia
      types too.

    Mike Burkey sent us new tweaked video modes:
      VGA     - 400x600x256   376x564x256   400x564x256
      ATI VGA - 832x612x256 New HP Paintjet support from Chris Martin
    New "FUNCTION=" command to allow substition of different
      transcendental functions for variables in types (allows one type
      with four of these variables to represent 7*7*7*7 different types!
    ALL KINDS of new fractal types, some using "FUNCTION=": fn(z*z),
      fn*fn, fn*z+z, fn+fn, sqr(1/fn), sqr(fn), spider, tetrate, and
      Manowar. Most of these are generalizations of formula fractal types
      contributed by Scott Taylor and Lee Skinner.
    Distance Estimator logic can now be applied to many fractal types
      using distest= option. The types "demm" and "demj" have been
      replaced by "type=mandel distest=nnn" and "type=julia distest=nnn"
    Added extended memory support for diskvideo thanks to Paul Varner
    Added support for "center and magnification" format for corners.
    Color 0 is no longer generated except when specifically requested with
      inside= or outside=.
    Formula name is now included in &lt;Tab&gt; display and in &lt;S&gt;aved images.
    Bug fixes - formula type and diskvideo, batch file outside=-1 problem.
    Now you can produce your favorite fractal terrains in full color
      instead of boring old monochrome! Use the fullcolor option in 3d!
      Along with a few new 3D options.
    New "INITORBIT=" command to allow alternate Mandelbrot set orbit
      initialization.

  Version 13.0, 5/90

    F1 was made the help key.
      Use F1 for help
      Use F9 for EGA 320x200x16 video mode
      Use CF4 for EGA 640x200x16 mode (if anybody uses that mode)
    Super-Solid-guessing (three or more passes) from Pieter Branderhorst
      (replaces the old solid-guessing mode)
    Boundary Tracing option from David Guenther ("fractint passes=btm", or
      use the new 'x' options screen)
    "outside=nnn" option sets all points not "inside" the fractal to color
      "nnn" (and generates a two-color image).
    'x' option from the main menu brings up a full-screen menu of many
      popular options and toggle switches
    "Speed Key" feature for fractal type selection (either use the cursor
      keys for point-and-shoot, or just start typing the name of your
      favorite fractal type)
    "Attractor" fractals (Henon, Rossler, Pickover, Gingerbread)
    Diffusion fractal type by Adrian Mariano
    "type=formula" formulas from Scott Taylor and Lee H. Skinner.
    "sound=" options for attractor fractals.  Sound=x  plays speaker tones
      according to the 'x' attractor value  Sound=y  plays speaker tones
      according to the 'y' attractor value.  Sound=z  plays speaker tones
      according to the 'z' attractor value  (These options are best
      invoked with the floating-point algorithm flag set.)
    "hertz=" option for adjusting the "sound=x/y/z" output.
    Printer support for color printers (printer=color) from Kurt Sowa
    Trident 4000 and Oak Technologies SuperVGA support from John Bridges
    Improved 8514/A support (the zoom-box keeps up with the cursor keys
    now!)
    Tandy 1000 640x200x16 mode from Brian Corbino (which does not, as yet,
      work with the F1(help) and TAB functions)
    The Julibrot fractal type and the Starmap option now automatically
      verify that they have been selected with a 256-color palette, and
      search for, and use, the appropriate GLASSESn.MAP or ALTERN.MAP
      palette map when invoked.  *You* were supposed to be doing that
      manually all along, but *you* probably never read the docs, huh?
    Bug Fixes:
      TAB key now works after R(estore) commands
      PS/2 Model 30 (MCGA) adapters should be able to select 320x200x256
        mode again (we think)
      Everex video adapters should work with the Autodetect modes again
        (we think)

  Version 12.0, 3/90

      fractals without using a "C" compiler!
    New 'Julibrot' fractal type
    Added floating point option to all remaining fractal types.
    Real (funny glasses) 3D - Now with "real-time" lorenz3D!!

      without stopping the generation of a fractal image
    New Cross-Hair mode for changing individual palette colors (VGA only)
    Zooming beyond the limits of Integer algorithms (with automatic
      switchover to a floating-point algorithm when you zoom in "too far")
    New 'inside=bof60', 'inside=bof61' ("Beauty of Fractals, Page nn")
    options
    New starmap ('a' - for astrology? astronomy?) transformation option
    Restrictions on the options available when using Expanded Memory
      "Disk/RAM" video mode have been removed
    And a lot of other nice little clean-up features that we've already
      forgotten that we've added...
    Added capability to create 3D projection images (just barely) for
      people with 2 or 4 color video boards.

      "Float=yes" option now determines whether integer or floating-point
      algorithms are used for most fractal types.  "F" command toggles the
      use of floating-point algorithms, flagged in the &lt;Tab&gt; status
      display
    8/16/32/../256-Way decomposition option (from Richard Finegold)
    "Biomorph=", "bailout=", "symmetry="  and "askvideo=" options
    "T(ransform)" option in the IFS editor lets you select 3D options
      (used with the Lorenz3D fractal type)
    The "T(ype)" command uses a new "Point-and-Shoot" method of selecting
      fractal types rather than prompting you for a type name
