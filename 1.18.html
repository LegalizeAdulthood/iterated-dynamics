 1.18 Fractint on Unix

  Fractint has been ported to Unix to run under X Windows.  This version
  is called "Xfractint".  Xfractint may be obtained by anonymous ftp, see
  Distribution of Fractint (p. 195).

  Xfractint is still under development and is not as reliable as the IBM
  PC version.

  Contact xfractint@fractint.org for more information on Xfractint.

  Xfractint is a straight port of the IBM PC version.  Thus, it uses the
  IBM user interface.  If you do not have function keys, or Xfractint does
  not accept them from your keyboard, use the following key mappings:

       IBM             Unix
       F1 to F10       Shift-1 to Shift-0
       INSERT          I
       DELETE          D
       PAGE_UP         U
       PAGE_DOWN       N
       LEFT_ARROW      H
       RIGHT_ARROW     L
       UP_ARROW        K
       DOWN_ARROW      J
       HOME            O
       END             E
       CTL_PLUS        }
       CTL_MINUS       {

  Xfractint takes the following options:

  -onroot
  Puts the image on the root window.

  -fast
  Uses a faster drawing technique.

  -disk
  Uses disk video.

  -geometry WxH[{+-X}{+-Y}]
  Changes the geometry of the image window.

  -display displayname
  Specifies the X11 display to use.

  -private
  Allocates the entire colormap (i.e. more colors).

  -share
  Shares the current colormap.

  -fixcolors n
  Uses only n colors.

  -slowdisplay
  Prevents Xfractint from hanging on the title page with slow displays.

  -simple
  Uses simpler keyboard handling, which makes debugging easier.

  Common problems:

  If you get the message "Couldn't find fractint.hlp", you can
  a) Do "setenv FRACTDIR /foo", replacing /foo with the directory
  containing fractint.hlp.
  b) Run Xfractint from the directory containing fractint.hlp, or
  c) Copy fractint.hlp to /usr/local/bin/X11/fractint

  If you get the message "Invalid help signature", the problem is due to
  byteorder.  You are probably using a Sun help file on a Dec machine or
  vice versa.

  If Xfractint doesn't accept input, try typing into both the graphics
  window and the text window.  On some systems, only one of these works.

  If you are using Openwindows and can't get Xfractint to accept input,
  add to your .Xdefaults file:
  OpenWindows.FocusLenience:      True

  If you cannot view the GIFs that Xfractint creates, the problem is that
  Xfractint creates GIF89a format and your viewer probably only handles
  GIF87a format.  Run "xfractint gif87a=y" to produce GIF87a format.

  Because many shifted characters are used to simulate IBM keys, you can't
  enter capitalized filenames.
