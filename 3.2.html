 3.2 Palette Maps

  If you have a VGA, MCGA, Super-VGA, 8514/A, XGA, TARGA, or TARGA+ video
  adapter, you can save and restore color palettes for use with any image.
  To load a palette onto an existing image, use the &lt;L&gt; command in color-
  cycling or palette-editing mode.  To save a palette, use the &lt;S&gt; command
  in those modes.  To change the default palette for an entire run, use
  the command line "map=" parameter.

  The default filetype for color-map files is ".MAP".

  These color-maps are ASCII text files set up as a series of RGB triplet
  values (one triplet per line, encoded as the red, green, and blue [RGB]
  components of the color).

  Note that .MAP file color values are in GIF format - values go from 0
  (low) to 255 (high), so for a VGA adapter they get divided by 4 before
  being stuffed into the VGA's Video-DAC registers (so '6' and '7' end up
  referring to the same color value).

  Fractint is distributed with some sample .MAP files:
