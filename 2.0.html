 2. Fractal Types

  A list of the fractal types and their mathematics can be found in the
  Summary of Fractal Types (p. 171).  Some notes about how Fractint
  calculates them are in "A Little Code" in "Fractals and the PC" (p. 164)
  .

  Fractint starts by default with the Mandelbrot set. You can change that
  by using the command-line argument "TYPE=" followed by one of the
  fractal type names, or by using the &lt;T&gt; command and selecting the type -
  if parameters are needed, you will be prompted for them.

  In the text that follows, due to the limitations of the ASCII character
  set, "a*b" means "a times b", and "a^b" means "a to the power b".
