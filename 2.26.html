 2.26 Orbit Fractals

  Orbit Fractals are generated by plotting an orbit path in two or three
  dimensional space.

  See Lorenz Attractors (p. 61), Rossler Attractors (p. 62), Henon
  Attractors (p. 62), Pickover Attractors (p. 63), Gingerbreadman
  (p. 63), and Martin Attractors (p. 63).

  The orbit trajectory for these types can be saved in the file ORBITS.RAW
  by invoking Fractint with the "orbitsave=yes" command-line option.  This
  file will be overwritten each time you generate a new fractal, so rename
  it if you want to save it.  A nifty program called Acrospin can read
  these files and rapidly rotate them in 3-D - see Acrospin (p. 203).
