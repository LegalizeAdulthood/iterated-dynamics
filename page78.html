 2.47 Cellular Automata

  (type=cellular)

  These fractals are generated by 1-dimensional cellular automata.
  Consider a 1-dimensional line of cells, where each cell can have the
  value 0 or 1.  In each time step, the new value of a cell is computed
  from the old value of the cell and the values of its neighbors.  On the
  screen, each horizontal row shows the value of the cells at any one
  time.  The time axis proceeds down the screen, with each row computed
  from the row above.

  Different classes of cellular automata can be described by how many
  different states a cell can have (k), and how many neighbors on each
  side are examined (r).  Fractint implements the binary nearest neighbor
  cellular automata (k=2,r=1), the binary next-nearest neighbor cellular
  automata (k=2,r=2), and the ternary nearest neighbor cellular automata
  (k=3,r=1) and several others.

  The rules used here determine the next state of a given cell by using
  the sum of the states in the cell's neighborhood.  The sum of the cells
  in the neighborhood are mapped by rule to the new value of the cell.
  For the binary nearest neighbor cellular automata, only the closest
  neighbor on each side is used.  This results in a 4 digit rule
  controlling the generation of each new line:  if each of the cells in
  the neighborhood is 1, the maximum sum is 1+1+1 = 3 and the sum can
  range from 0 to 3, or 4 values.  This results in a 4 digit rule.  For
  instance, in the rule 1010, starting from the right we have 0-&gt;0, 1-&gt;1,
  2-&gt;0, 3-&gt;1.  If the cell's neighborhood sums to 2, the new cell value
  would be 0.

  For the next-nearest cellular automata (kr = 22), each pixel is
  determined from the pixel value and the two neighbors on each side.
  This results in a 6 digit rule.

  For the ternary nearest neighbor cellular automata (kr = 31), each cell
  can have the value 0, 1, or 2.  A single neighbor on each side is
  examined, resulting in a 7 digit rule.

  The starting row of cells can be set to a pattern of up to 16 digits or
  to a random pattern.  The borders are set to zeros if a pattern is
  entered or are set randomly if the starting row is set randomly.

  A zero rule will randomly generate the rule to use.
