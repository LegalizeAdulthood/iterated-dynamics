   o set view parameters: preview to yes, reduction to anything (say 2),
     aspect ratio to 1.6, and crop to yes
   o zoom, rotate, whatever, till you get the desired final image
   o set preview display back to no
   o trigger final calculation in some high res disk video mode, using the
     appropriate video mode function key
   o print directly to a PostScript printer, or save the result as a GIF
     file and use external utilities to convert to hard copy.


 1.13 Video Mode Function Keys

  Fractint supports *so* many video modes that we've given up trying to
  reserve a keyboard combination for each of them.

  Any supported video mode can be selected by going to the "Select Video
  Mode" screen (from main menu or by using &lt;Delete&gt;), then using the
  cursor up and down arrow keys and/or &lt;PageUp&gt; and &lt;PageDown&gt; keys to
  highlight the desired mode, then pressing &lt;Enter&gt;.

  Up to 39 modes can be assigned to the keys F2-F10, SF1-SF10
  &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Fn&gt;), CF1-CF10 (&lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Fn&gt;), and AF1-AF10 (&lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Fn&gt;).  The
  modes assigned to function keys can be invoked directly by pressing the
  assigned key, without going to the video mode selection screen.

  30 key combinations can be reassigned:  &lt;F1&gt; to &lt;F10&gt; combined with any
  of &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;, or &lt;Alt&gt;.  The video modes assigned to &lt;F2&gt; through
  &lt;F10&gt; can not be changed - these are assigned to the most common video
  modes, which might be used in demonstration files or batches.

  To reassign a function key to a mode you often use, go to the "select
  video mode" screen, highlight the video mode, press the keypad (gray)
  &lt;+&gt; key, then press the desired function key or key combination.  The
  new key assignment will be remembered for future runs.

  To unassign a key (so that it doesn't invoke any video mode), highlight
  the mode currently selected by the key and press the keypad (gray) &lt;-&gt;
  key.

  A note about the "select video modes" screen: the video modes which are
  displayed with a 'B' suffix in the number of colors are modes which have
  no custom programming - they use the BIOS and are S-L-O-W ones.

  See "Video Adapter Notes" (p. 153) for comments about particular
  adapters.

  See "Disk-Video" Modes (p. 156) for a description of these non-display
  modes.

  See "Customized Video Modes, FRACTINT.CFG" (p. 157) for information
  about adding your own video modes.
