  Versions 18.1 and 18.2 are bug-fix releases for version 18.0.  Changes
  from 18.1 to 18.2 include:

   The &lt;b&gt; command now causes filenames only to be written in PAR files.

   Fractint will now search directories in the PATH for files not found in
   the requested the requested directory or the current directory. If you
   place .MAP, .FRM, etc. in directories in your PATH, then Fractint will
   find them.

   Fixed bug that caused fractals using PI symmetry to fail at high
   resolution.

   Fractals interrupted with &lt;3&gt; or &lt;r&gt; can now resume.

   The palette editor's &lt;u&gt; (undo) now works.

   The &lt;s&gt; command in orbit/Julia window mode is no longer case sensitive.

   Added warnings that the POV-Ray output is obsolete (but has been left
   in).  Use POV-Ray's height field facility instead or create and convert
   RAW files.

   Fixed several IFS bugs.

  Changes from 18.0 to 18.1 include:

   Overlay tuning - the Mandelbrot/Julia Set fractals are now back up to
   17.x speeds

   Disk Video modes now work correctly with VESA video adapters (they used
   to use the same array for different purposes, confusing each other)

   1024x768x256 and 2048x2048x256 disk video modes work again

   Parameter-file processing no longer crashes Fractint if it attempts to
   run a formula requiring access to a non-existent FRM file

   IFS arrays no longer overrun their array space

   type=cellular fixes

   "autologmap=2" now correctly picks up the minimum color

   The use of disk-video mode with random-access fractal types is now
   legal (it generates a warning message but lets you proceed if you
   really want to)

   The Lsystems "spinning-wheel" now spins slower (removing needless
   overhead)

   Changes to contributors' addresses in the Help screens

  (The remainder of this "new features" section is from version 18.0)

  New fractal types:

   19 new fractal types, including:

   New fractal types - 'lambda(fn||fn)', 'julia(fn||fn)',
   'manlam(fn||fn)', 'mandel(fn||fn)', 'halley', 'phoenix', 'mandphoenix',
   'cellular', generalized bifurcation, and 'bifmay' - from Jonathan
   Osuch.

   New Mandelcloud, Quaternion, Dynamic System, Cellular Automata fractal
   types from Ken Shirriff.

   New HyperComplex fractal types from Timothy Wegner

   New ICON type from Dan Farmer, including a PAR file of examples.

   New Frothy Basin fractal types (and PAR entries) by Wesley Loewer

   MIIM (Modified Inverse Iteration Method) implementation of Inverse
   Julia from Michael Snyder.

   New Inverse Julia fractal type from Juan Buhler.

   New floating-point versions of Markslambda, Marksmandel, Mandel4, and
   Julia4 types (chosen automatically if the floating-point option is
   enabled).

  New options/features:

   New assembler-based parser logic from Chuck Ebbert - significantly
   faster than the C-based code it replaces!

   New assembler-based Lyapunov logic from Nicholas Wilt and Wes Loewer.
   Roughly six times faster than the old version!

   New Orbits-on-a-window / Julia-in-a-window options:
    1) The old Overlay option is now '#' (Shift-3).
    2) During generation, 'O' brings up orbits (as before) - after
       generation, 'O' brings up new orbits Windows mode.
    3) Control-O brings up new orbits Windows mode at any time.
    4) Spacebar toggles between Inverse Julia mode and the Julia set and
       back to the Mandelbrot set.
   These new "in-a-window" modes are really neat!  See Orbits Window
   (p. 34) and Julia Toggle Spacebar Commands (p. 45) for details.

   New multi-image GIF support in the &lt;B&gt; command.  You can now generate
   65535x65535x256 fractal images using Fractint (if you have the disk
   space, of course).  This option builds special PAR entries and a
   MAKEMIG.BAT file that you later use to invoke Fractint multiple times
   to generate individual sections of the image and (in a final step)
   stitch them all together.  If your other software can't handle
   Multiple-image GIFs, a SIMPLGIF program is also supplied that converts
   MIGS into simgle-image GIFs.  Press F1 at the &lt;B&gt; prompts screen for
   details.

   Fractint's decoder now handles Multi-Image Gifs.

   New SuperVGA/VESA Autodetect logic from the latest version of VGAKIT.
   Sure hope we didn't break anything.

   New register-compatible 8514/A code from Jonathan Osuch.  By default,
   Fractint now looks first for the presence of an 8514/A register-
   compatible adapter and then (and only if it doesn't find one) the
   presence of the 8514/A API (IE, HDILOAD is no longer necessary for
   register-compatible "8514/a" adapters).  Fractint can be forced to use
   the 8514/A API by using a new command-line option, "afi=yes".  Jonathan
   also added ATI's "8514/a-style" 800x600x256 and 1280x1024x16 modes.

   New XGA-detection logic for ISA-based XGA-2 systems.

   The palette editor now has a "freestyle" editing option.  See Palette
   Editing Commands (p. 25) for details.


   Fractint is now more "batch file" friendly.  When running Fractint from
   a batch file, pressing any key will cause Fractint to exit with an
   errorlevel = 2.  Any error that interrupts an image save to disk will
   cause an exit with errorlevel = 2.  Any error that prevents an image
   from being generated will cause an exit with errorlevel = 1.

   New Control-X, Control-Y, and Control-Z options flip a fractal image
   along the X-axis, Y-axis, and Origin, respectively.

   New area calculation mode in TAB screen from Ken Shirriff (for accuracy
   use inside=0).

   The TAB screen now indicates when the Integer Math algorithms are in
   use.

   The palette must now be explicitly changed, it will not reset to the
   default unexpectedly when doing things like switching video modes.

   The Julibrot type has been generalized.  Julibrot fractals can now be
   generated from PAR files.

   Added &lt;b&gt; command support for viewwindows.

   Added room for two additional PAR comments in the &lt;B&gt; command

   New coloring method for IFS shows which parts of fractal came from
   which transform.

   Added attractor basin phase plotting for Julia sets from Ken Shirriff.

   Improved finite attractor code to find more attractors from Ken
   Shirriff.

   New zero function, to be used in PAR files to replace old integer tan,
   tanh

   Debugflag=10000 now reports video chipset in use as well as CPU/FPU
   type and available memory

   Added 6 additional parameters for params= for those fractal types that
   need them.

   New 'matherr()' logic lets Fractint get more aggressive when these
   errors happen.

   New autologmap option (log=+-2) from Robin Bussell that ensures that
   all palette values are used by searching the screen border for the
   lowest value and then setting log= to +- that color.

   Two new diffusion options - falling and square cavity.

   Three new Editpal commands: '!', '@' and '#' commands (that's &lt;shift-
   1&gt;, &lt;shift-2&gt;, and &lt;shift-3&gt;) to swap R&lt;-&gt;G, G&lt;-&gt;B, R&lt;-&gt;B.

   Parameter files now use a slightly shorter maximum line length, making
   them a bit more readable when stuffed into messages on CompuServe.

   Plasma now has 16-bit .POT output for use with Ray tracers. The "old"
   algorithm has been modified so that the plasma effect is independent of
   resolution.

   Slight modification to the Raytrace code to make it compatible with
   Rayshade 4.0 patch level 6.

   Improved boundary-tracing logic from Wesley Loewer.

   Command-line parameters can now be entered on-the-fly using the &lt;g&gt; key
   thanks to Ken Shirriff.

   Dithered gif images can now be loaded onto a b/w display.  Thanks to
   Ken Shirriff.

   Pictures can now be output as compressed PostScript.  Thanks to Ken
   Shirriff.

   Periodicity is a new inside coloring option.  Thanks to Ken Shirriff.

   Fixes: symmetry values for the SQR functions, bailout for the floating-
   pt versions of 'lambdafn' and 'mandelfn' fractals from Jonathan Osuch.

   "Flip", "conj" operators are now selectable in the parser

   New DXF Raytracing option from Dennis Bragg.

   Improved boundary-tracing logic from Wesley Loewer.

   New MSC7-style overlay structure is used if MAKEFRAC.BAT specifies
   MSC7.  (with new FRACTINT.DEF and FRACTINT.LNK files for MSC7 users).
   Several modules have been re-organized to take advantage of this new
   overlay capability if compiled under MSC7.

   Fractint now looks first any embedded help inside FRACTINT.EXE, and
   then for an external FRACTINT.HLP file before giving up. Previous
   releases required that the help text be embedded inside FRACTINT.EXE.

  Bug fixes:

   Corrected formulas displayed for Marksmandel, Cmplxmarksmandel, and
    associated julia types.

   BTM and precision fixes.

   Symmetry logic changed for various "outside=" options

   Symmetry value for EXP function in lambdafn and lambda(fn||fn) fixed.

   Fixed bug where math errors prevented save in batch mode.

   The &lt;3&gt; and &lt;r&gt; commands no longer destroy image -- user can back out
   with ESC and image is still there.

   Fixed display of correct number of Julibrot parameters, and Julibrot
   relaxes and doesn't constantly force ALTERN.MAP.

   Fixed tesseral type for condition when border is all one color but
   center contains image.

   Fixed integer mandel and julia when used with parameters &gt; +1.99 and &lt;
   -1.99

   Eliminated recalculation when generating a julia type from a mandelbrot
   type when the 'z' screen is viewed for the first time.

   Minor logic change to prevent double-clutching into and out of graphics
   mode when pressing, say, the 'x' key from a menu screen.

   Changed non-US phone number for the Houston Public (Software) Library

   The "Y" screen is now "Extended Options" instead of "Extended Doodads"

   ...and probably a lot more bux-fixes that we've since forgotten that
   we've implemented.


  Version 17.2, 3/92

   - Fixed a bug which caused Fractint to hang when a Continuous Potential
     Bailout value was set (using the 'Y') screen and then the 'Z' screen
     was activated.
   - fixed a bug which caused "batch=yes" runs to abort whenever any
     key was pressed.
   - bug-fixes in the Stereo3D/Targa logic from Marc Reinig.
   - Fractint now works correctly again on FPU-less 8088s when
     zoomed deeply into the Mandelbrot/Julia sets
   - The current image is no longer marked as "not resumable" on a
     Shell-To-Dos ("D") command.
   - fixed a bug which prevented the "help" functions from working
