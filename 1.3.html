 1.3 Zoom box Commands

  Zoom Box functions can be invoked while an image is being generated or
  when it has been completely drawn.  Zooming is supported for most
  fractal types, but not all.

  The general approach to using the zoom box is:  Frame an area using the
  keys described below, then &lt;Enter&gt; to expand what's in the frame to fill
  the whole screen (zoom in); or &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; to shrink the current image
  into the framed area (zoom out). With a mouse, double-click the left
  button to zoom in, double click the right button to zoom out.

  &lt;Page Up&gt;, &lt;Page Down&gt;
  Use &lt;Page Up&gt; to initially bring up the zoom box. It starts at full
  screen size. Subsequent use of these keys makes the zoom box smaller or
  larger.  Using &lt;Page Down&gt; to enlarge the zoom box when it is already at
  maximum size removes the zoom box from the display. Moving the mouse
  away from you or toward you while holding the left button down performs
  the same functions as these keys.

  Using the cursor "arrow" keys or moving the mouse without holding any
  buttons down, moves the zoom box.

  Holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; while pressing cursor "arrow" keys moves the box 5 times
  faster.  (This only works with enhanced keyboards.)

  Panning: If you move a fullsize zoombox and don't change anything else
  before performing the zoom, Fractint just moves what's already on the
  screen and then fills in the new edges, to reduce drawing time. This
  feature applies to most fractal types but not all.  A side effect is
  that while an image is incomplete, a full size zoom box moves in steps
  larger than one pixel.  Fractint keeps the box on multiple pixel
  boundaries, to make panning possible.  As a multi-pass (e.g. solid
  guessing) image approaches completion, the zoom box can move in smaller
  increments.

  In addition to resizing the zoom box and moving it around, you can do
  some rather warped things with it.  If you're a new Fractint user, we
  recommend skipping the rest of the zoom box functions for now and coming
  back to them when you're comfortable with the basic zoom box functions.

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Keypad-&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Keypad+&gt;
  Holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; and pressing the numeric keypad's + or - keys rotates the
  zoom box. Moving the mouse left or right while holding the right button
  down performs the same function.

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Page Up&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Page Down&gt;
  These commands change the zoom box's "aspect ratio", stretching or
  shrinking it vertically. Moving the mouse away from you or toward you
  while holding both buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse)
  down performs the same function. There are no commands to directly
  stretch or shrink the zoom box horizontally - the same effect can be
  achieved by combining vertical stretching and resizing.

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Home&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;End&gt;
  These commands "skew" the zoom box, moving the top and bottom edges in
  opposite directions. Moving the mouse left or right while holding both
  buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse) down performs the
  same function. There are no commands to directly skew the left and right
  edges - the same effect can be achieved by using these functions
  combined with rotation.

  &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Insert&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Delete&gt;
  These commands change the zoom box color. This is useful when you're
  having trouble seeing the zoom box against the colors around it. Moving
  the mouse away from you or toward you while holding the right button
  down performs the same function.

  You may find it difficult to figure out what combination of size,
  position rotation, stretch, and skew to use to get a particular result.
  (We do.)
  A good way to get a feel for all these functions is to play with the
  Gingerbreadman fractal type. Gingerbreadman's shape makes it easy to see
  what you're doing to him. A warning though: Gingerbreadman will run
  forever, he's never quite done! So, pre-empt with your next zoom when
  he's baked enough.

  If you accidentally change your zoom box shape or rotate and forget
  which way is up, just use &lt;PageDown&gt; to make it bigger until it
  disappears, then &lt;PageUp&gt; to get a fresh one.  With a mouse, after
  removing the old zoom box from the display release and re-press the left
  button for a fresh one.

  If your screen does not have a 4:3 "aspect ratio" (i.e. if the visible
  display area on it is not 1.333 times as wide as it is high), rotating
  and zooming will have some odd effects - angles will change, including
  the zoom box's shape itself, circles (if you are so lucky as to see any
  with a non-standard aspect ratio) become non-circular, and so on. The
  vast majority of PC screens *do* have a 4:3 aspect ratio.

  Zooming is not implemented for the plasma and diffusion fractal types,
  nor for overlayed and 3D images. A few fractal types support zooming but
  do not support rotation and skewing - nothing happens when you try it.
