 2.20 Pickover Popcorn

  (type=popcorn/popcornjul)

  Here is another Pickover idea. This one computes and plots the orbits of
  the dynamic system defined by:

      x(n+1) = x(n) - real(h * fn1( y(n) + fn2(C * y(n) ))
                    - imag(h * fn3( x(n) + fn4(C * x(n) ))
      y(n+1) = y(n) - real(h * fn3( x(n) + fn4(C * x(n) ))
                    - imag(h * fn1( y(n) + fn2(C * y(n) ))

  In the original the functions were: sin, tan, sin, tan, and C was 3.

  The initializers x(0) and y(0) equal to ALL the complex values within
  the "corners" values, and h=.01.  ALL these orbits are superimposed,
  resulting in "popcorn" effect.  You may want to use a maxiter value less
  than normal - Pickover recommends a value of 50.  Although you can zoom
  and rotate popcorn, the results may not be what you'd expect, due to the
  superimposing of orbits and arbitrary use of color.  The orbits
  frequently occur outside of the screen boundaries.  To view the fractal
  in its entirety, set the preview display to "yes" using the "V" command.

  As a bonus, type=popcornjul shows the Julia set generated by these same
  equations with the usual escape-time coloring. Turn on orbit viewing
  with the "O" command, and as you watch the orbit pattern you may get
  some insight as to where the popcorn comes from.
