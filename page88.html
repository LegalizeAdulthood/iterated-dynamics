  zooms, but only up to the limit of double precision. Within this narrow
  magnification range, SOI can result in tremndous speedups. If you invoke
  fractint with "debug=3444" on the command line, a long double (rather
  than double) version will be used, which allows zooming about 1000 times
  deeper. SOI really needs to be ported to fractint's arbitary precision.
  This will likely happen only after Fractint is moved to a better
  programming environment.


 3.2 Palette Maps

  If you have a VGA, MCGA, Super-VGA, 8514/A, XGA, TARGA, or TARGA+ video
  adapter, you can save and restore color palettes for use with any image.
  To load a palette onto an existing image, use the &lt;L&gt; command in color-
  cycling or palette-editing mode.  To save a palette, use the &lt;S&gt; command
  in those modes.  To change the default palette for an entire run, use
  the command line "map=" parameter.

  The default filetype for color-map files is ".MAP".

  These color-maps are ASCII text files set up as a series of RGB triplet
  values (one triplet per line, encoded as the red, green, and blue [RGB]
  components of the color).

  Note that .MAP file color values are in GIF format - values go from 0
  (low) to 255 (high), so for a VGA adapter they get divided by 4 before
  being stuffed into the VGA's Video-DAC registers (so '6' and '7' end up
  referring to the same color value).

  Fractint is distributed with some sample .MAP files:
     ALTERN.MAP    the famous "Peterson-Vigneau Pseudo-Grey Scale"
     BLUES.MAP     for rainy days, by Daniel Egnor
     CHROMA.MAP    general purpose, chromatic
     DEFAULT.MAP   the VGA start-up values
     FIRESTRM.MAP  general purpose, muted fire colors
     GAMMA1.MAP and GAMMA2.MAP  Lee Crocker's response to ALTERN.MAP
     GLASSES1.MAP  used with 3d glasses modes
     GLASSES2.MAP  used with 3d glasses modes
     GOODEGA.MAP   for EGA users
     GREEN.MAP     shaded green
     GREY.MAP      another grey variant
     GRID.MAP      for stereo surface grid images
     HEADACHE.MAP  major stripes, by D. Egnor (try cycling and hitting &lt;2&gt;)
     LANDSCAP.MAP  Guruka Singh Khalsa's favorite map for plasma "landscapes"
     NEON.MAP      a flashy map, by Daniel Egnor
     PAINTJET.MAP  high resolution mode PaintJet colors
     ROYAL.MAP     the royal purple, by Daniel Egnor
     TOPO.MAP      Monte Davis's contribution to full color terrain
     VOLCANO.MAP   an explosion of lava, by Daniel Egnor
