 5.20 Browser Parameters

  This Screen enables you to control Fractint's built in file browsing
  utility.  If you don't know what that is see Browse Commands (p. 37).
  This screen is selected with &lt;Ctrl-B&gt; from just about anywhere.

  "Autobrowsing"
  Select yes if you want the loaded image to be scanned for sub images
  immediately without pressing 'L' every time.

  "Ask about GIF video mode"
  Allows turning on and off the display of the video mode table when
  loading GIFs.  This has the same effect as the askvideo= command.

  "Type/Parm check"
  Select whether the browser tests for fractal type or parms when deciding
  whether a file is a sub image of the current screen or not. DISABLE WITH
  CAUTION! or things could get confusing. These tests can be switched off
  to allow such situations as wishing to display old images that were
  generated using a formula type which is now implemented as a built in
  fractal type.
  "Confirm deletes"
  Set this to No if you get fed up with the double prompting that the
  browser gives when deleting a file.  It won't get rid of the first
  prompt however.

  "Smallest window"
  This parameter determines how small the image would have to be onscreen
  before the browser decides not to include it in the selection of files.
  The size is entered in decimal pixels so, for instance, this could be
  set to 0.2 to allow images that are up to around three maximum zooms
  away (depending on the current video resolution) to be loaded instantly.
  Set this to 0 to enable all sub images to be detected.  This can lead to
  a very cluttered screen!  The primary use is in conjunction with the
  search file mask (see below) to allow location of high magnification
  images within an overall view (like the whole Mset).

  "Smallest box"
  This determines when the image location is shown as crosshairs rather
  than a rather small box.  Set this according to how good your eyesight
  is (probably worse than before you started staring at fractals all the
  time :-)) or the resolution of your screen.  WARNING the crosshairs
  routine centers the cursor on one corner of the image box at the moment
  so this looks misleading if set too large.
  "Search Mask"
  Sets the file name pattern which the browser searches, this can be used
  to search out the location of a file by setting this to the filename and
  setting smallest image to 0 (see above).
